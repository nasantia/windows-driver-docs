Because DevCon operations use IDs and ID patterns to identify devices, a common first step in using DevCon is to create a hardware ID reference file for devices on the computer.

The following command uses the [**DevCon HwIDs**](devcon-hwids.md) operation, which returns the IDs and the device description. It uses the wildcard character (**\***) to represent all devices on the local computer.

```
devcon hwids *
```

Because the output is lengthy and used repeatedly, save the output in a text file for reference.

The following command uses the wildcard character (**\***) to represent all devices on the computer. It uses the redirection character (*<em>&gt;</em>*) to save the command output in the hwids.txt file.

```
devcon hwids * > hwids.txt
```

The following command finds the hardware IDs of devices on a remote computer, Server01. It uses the **/m** parameter to specify the name of the remote computer. The command redirects the output to the server01\_hwids.txt file for later reference.

**Note**   This command fails unless the user has the required permissions on the remote computer. To run DevCon commands on a remote computer, the Group Policy setting must allow the Plug and Play service to run on the remote computer. On computers that run Windows Vista and Windows 7, the Group Policy disables remote access to the service by default. On computers that run Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8.1 and Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 8, the remote access is unavailable.

 

```
devcon /m:\\server01 hwids * > server01_hwids.txt
```

### <span id="ddk_example_2_find_hardware_ids_by_using_a_pattern_tools"></span><span id="DDK_EXAMPLE_2_FIND_HARDWARE_IDS_BY_USING_A_PATTERN_TOOLS"></span><a name="ddk_example_2_find_hardware_ids_by_using_a_pattern_tools"></a>Example 2: Find hardware IDs by using a pattern

To find the hardware IDs of a particular device, enter the hardware ID or pattern, the compatible ID or pattern, the device instance ID or pattern, or the name of the device setup class.

The following command uses the **DevCon HwIDs** operation and a pattern to find the hardware IDs of the floppy disk drive on the computer. (The user assumes that the pattern appears in one of the device identifiers.) The command uses the wildcard character (**\***) to represent all characters that might precede or follow the word "floppy" in any of the IDs.

```
devcon hwids *floppy*
```

In response, DevCon displays the device instance ID, hardware ID, and compatible ID of the floppy disk drive on the computer. You can use these IDs in subsequent DevCon commands.

```
FDC\GENERIC_FLOPPY_DRIVE\5&39194F6D&0&0
    Name: Floppy disk drive
    Hardware ID's:
        FDC\GENERIC_FLOPPY_DRIVE
    Compatible ID's:
        GenFloppyDisk
1 matching device(s) found.
```

In this case, the phrase "floppy" occurs in the hardware ID or compatible ID of only one device on the computer. If it occurs in the ID of more than one device, all devices with "floppy" in their IDs appear in the output.

### <span id="ddk_example_3_find_hardware_ids_by_using_a_class_tools"></span><span id="DDK_EXAMPLE_3_FIND_HARDWARE_IDS_BY_USING_A_CLASS_TOOLS"></span><a name="ddk_example_3_find_hardware_ids_by_using_a_class_tools"></a>Example 3: Find hardware IDs by using a class

The following command uses the [**DevCon HwIDs**](devcon-hwids.md) operation and a device setup class to find the hardware IDs of all devices in the Ports device setup class. The equal sign (**=**) preceding the class name indicates that it is a class, not an ID.

```
devcon hwids =ports
```

In response, DevCon displays the hardware IDs and compatible IDs of the three devices in the Ports setup class.

```

Because DevCon operations can use the device setup class to identify devices, it is useful to create a reference file of the device setup classes of devices on the computer.

The following command uses the [**DevCon Classes**](devcon-classes.md) operation, which returns a list and description of all classes on the computer.

```
devcon classes
```

Because the output is lengthy and used repeatedly, save the output in a text file for reference.

The following command displays all device classes on the computer. It uses the redirection character (**&gt;**) to save the command output in the classes.txt file.

```
devcon classes > classes.txt
```

### <span id="ddk_example_5_list_classes_on_the_remote_computer_tools"></span><span id="DDK_EXAMPLE_5_LIST_CLASSES_ON_THE_REMOTE_COMPUTER_TOOLS"></span><a name="ddk_example_5_list_classes_on_the_remote_computer_tools"></a>Example 5: List classes on the remote computer

The following command uses the [**DevCon Classes**](devcon-classes.md) operation to list the device setup classes on a remote computer, Server01:

```
devcon /m:\\server01 classes
```

Because the output is lengthy and used repeatedly, save the output in a text file for reference.

The following command uses the redirection character (**&gt;**) to save the command output in the server01\_classes.txt file.

```
devcon /m:\\server01 classes > server01_classes.txt
```

### <span id="ddk_example_6_list_the_devices_in_a_device_setup_class_tools"></span><span id="DDK_EXAMPLE_6_LIST_THE_DEVICES_IN_A_DEVICE_SETUP_CLASS_TOOLS"></span><a name="ddk_example_6_list_the_devices_in_a_device_setup_class_tools"></a>Example 6: List the devices in a device setup class

The following command uses the [**DevCon ListClass**](devcon-listclass.md) operation to list the devices in Net, the device setup class for network adapters.

```
devcon listclass net
```

In response, DevCon displays the device instance ID and description of each device in the Net setup class.

```
Listing 6 device(s) for setup class "Net" (Network adapters).

ROOT\MS_PTIMINIPORT\0000                                    : Direct Parallel
```

This display, although interesting, does not provide the hardware IDs of the devices in the Net setup class. The following command uses the [**DevCon HwIDs**](devcon-hwids.md) operation to list the devices in the Net setup class. In a **DevCon HwIDs** command, the class name is preceded by an equal sign (**=**) to indicate that it is a class, not an ID.

```
devcon hwids =net
```

The resulting display lists the devices in the Net class and includes the device instance ID, hardware IDs, and compatible IDs of devices in the class.

The following command uses the [**DevCon DriverFiles**](devcon-driverfiles.md) operation to list the file names of drivers that devices on the system use. The command uses the wildcard character (**\***) to indicate all devices on the system. Because the output is extensive, the command uses the redirection character (*<em>&gt;</em>*) to redirect the output to a reference file, driverfiles.txt.

```

The following command uses the [**DevCon Find**](devcon-find.md) operation to search for mouse devices on Server01, a remote computer. Specifically, the command searches the Server01 computer for devices whose hardware ID or compatible ID includes "mou."

```
devcon /m:\\Server01 find *mou*
```

In this case, DevCon found both two mouse devices.

```

```

Because all DevCon display operations also find hardware IDs, you can use any display operation to search for hardware IDs. Select the operation based on the content that you need in the output. For example, to find the device drivers that mouse-related devices on a local computer use, submit the following command.

```

The following commands use the [**DevCon Find**](devcon-find.md) operation to display all legacy devices on the local computer. Because legacy devices do not have a hardware ID, you must search for them by their device instance ID (registry path), ROOT\\LEGACY, or their setup class, LegacyDriver.

The first command finds legacy drivers by a device instance ID pattern. The ID pattern is prefaced by the at character (**@**) to indicate a device instance ID and followed by the wildcard character (**\***) to find all devices in the ROOT\\Legacy subkey.

```
devcon find @root\legacy*
```

The second command finds legacy devices by searching for all devices in the LegacyDriver class.

```
devcon find =legacydriver
```

Both commands produce the same output, in this case, finding the same 27 legacy devices.

The following command uses the [**DevCon ClassFilter**](devcon-classfilter.md) operation to display the upper filter drivers for the DiskDrive setup class. Because this command includes no classfilter operators, DevCon displays the filter drivers for the class, but does not change them.

```
devcon classfilter DiskDrive upper
```

In response, DevCon displays the upper filter drivers for the DiskDrive class and confirms that it did not change them. In this case, the display shows that devices in the DiskDrive setup class use the PartMgr.sys upper filter driver.

```
Class filters unchanged.
    PartMgr
```

### <span id="ddk_example_24_add_a_filter_driver_to_a_setup_class_tools"></span><span id="DDK_EXAMPLE_24_ADD_A_FILTER_DRIVER_TO_A_SETUP_CLASS_TOOLS"></span><a name="ddk_example_24_add_a_filter_driver_to_a_setup_class_tools"></a>Example 24: Add a filter driver to a setup class

The following command uses the [**DevCon ClassFilter**](devcon-classfilter.md) operation to add a fictitious filter, Disklog.sys, to the list of upper filter drivers for the DiskDrive setup class.

This command uses the add-after (**+**) ClassFilter operator to load the Disklog driver after the PartMgr driver so that it receives data that PartMgr.sys has already processed.

When the command starts, the virtual cursor is positioned before the first filter driver. Because it is not positioned on a particular driver, DevCon adds the Disklog driver to the end of the filter driver list.

The command also uses the **/r** parameter, which reboots the system if it is necessary to make the class filter change effective.

```
devcon /r classfilter DiskDrive upper +Disklog
```

In response, DevCon displays the current upper filter drivers for the DiskDrive class.

```
Class filters changed. Class devices must be restarted for changes to take effect.
    PartMgr
    Disklog
```

If you misspell the driver name, or try to add a driver that isn't installed on the system, the command fails. DevCon does not add a driver unless the driver is registered as a service, that is, unless the driver has a subkey in the Services registry subkey (HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services).

The following command tests this safeguard feature. It attempts to add "Disklgg" (instead of "Disklog") to the list of upper filters for the DiskDrive class. The output demonstrates that the command fails.

```
devcon /r classfilter DiskDrive upper +Disklgg
devcon failed.
```

The following command uses the [**DevCon ClassFilter**](devcon-classfilter.md) operation to add a fictitious filter driver, MyFilter.sys, to the list of upper filter drivers for the DiskDrive setup class. The command places MyFilter.sys between PartMgr.sys and Disklog.sys in the load order.

```
devcon /r classfilter DiskDrive upper @Disklog -MyFilter
```

The following list shows the filter drivers for the DiskDrive class before the command is submitted.

```
    PartMgr
    Disklog
```

The first subcommand, <strong>@Disklog</strong>, uses the positioning operator (**@**) to place the virtual cursor on the Disklog filter driver. The second subcommand, **-MyFilter**, uses the add-before operator (**-**) to add MyFilter.sys before Disklog.sys.

The command also uses the **/r** parameter, which reboots the system if it is necessary to make the class filter change effective.

The positioning operator is essential in this example. Before DevCon processes any classfilter subcommands, the virtual cursor is at the beginning of the list and is not positioned on any filter drivers. If you use the add-before (**+**) operator when the cursor is not on positioned on a driver, DevCon adds the driver to the beginning of the list. If you use the add-after (**-**) operator when the cursor is not positioned on a driver, it adds the driver to the end of the list.

In response, DevCon displays the current upper filter drivers for the DiskDrive class.

```
Class filters changed. Class devices must be restarted for changes to take effect.
    PartMgr
    MyFilter
    Disklog
```

You can also use the following command to add the MyFilter driver and to place it between PartMgr and Disklog. In this example, the first subcommand, <strong>@PartMgr</strong>, positions the virtual cursor on the PartMgr filter driver. The second subcommand, **+MyFilter**, uses the add-after operator (+) to add MyFilter.sys after PartMgr.

```
devcon /r classfilter DiskDrive upper @PartMgr +MyFilter
```

The following command uses the [**DevCon ClassFilter**](devcon-classfilter.md) operation to replace the original copy of MyFilter.sys with a new and improved version, MyNewFilter.sys, in the list of filter drivers for the DiskDrive setup class.

```
devcon /r classfilter DiskDrive upper !MyFilter +MyNewFilter
```

The following list shows the filter drivers for the DiskDrive class before the command is submitted.

```
    PartMgr
    MyFilter
    Disklog
```

The first subcommand uses the delete operator (**!**) to delete MyFilter from the list of upper filter drivers for the DiskDrive class. (It does not affect the MyFilter.sys file in the C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers directory.)

The second subcommand uses the add-after operator (**+**) to place the new filter driver in the position that the deleted driver occupied. Because the delete operator leaves the cursor in the position that the deleted filter occupied, the add-before (**-**) and add-after (**+**) operators have the same effect.)

The command also uses the **/r** parameter, which reboots the system if it is necessary to make the class filter change effective.

In response, DevCon shows the new class filter configuration for the DiskDrive class.

```
Class filters changed. Class devices must be restarted for changes to take effect.

The following command uses the [**DevCon ClassFilter**](devcon-classfilter.md) operation to change the order of filter drivers for the DiskDrive setup class. Specifically, it reverses the order of the second and third filter drivers.

```
devcon /r classfilter DiskDrive upper !Disklog =@PartMgr +Disklog
```

The following list shows the filter drivers for the DiskDrive class before the command is submitted. It also shows the intended result of the command.

The first subcommand uses the delete operator (**!)** to delete Disklog from the list. The second subcommand uses the start operator (**=)** to move the virtual cursor back to the starting position and then uses the positioning operator (**@)** to place the cursor on the PartMgr driver. The start operator is necessary because the virtual cursor moves only forward through the list. The final subcommand uses the add-after operator (**+)** to add Disklog after PartMgr.

In response, DevCon shows the new class filter configuration for the DiskDrive class.

The following command uses the [**DevCon Enable**](devcon-enable.md) operation to enable a programmable interrupt controller that had been disabled to correct a system problem. Because the controller hardware ID \*PNP0000 includes an asterisk, the command uses the single quote character (**'**) to direct DevCon to find the hardware ID precisely as it is specified in the command. Otherwise, the asterisk would be interpreted as a wildcard character.

```
devcon enable '*PNP0000
```

In response, DevCon displays the device instance ID of the device and explains that you must reboot the system to enable the device.

```
ACPI\PNP0000\4&B4063F4&0                                    : Enabled on reboot
Not all of 1 device(s) enabled, at least one requires reboot to complete the operation.
```

You can respond by rebooting the system, either manually, or by using the [**DevCon Reboot**](devcon-reboot.md) operation.

The following command adds the **/r** parameter to the previous command. The **/r** parameter reboots the system only if rebooting is required to complete an operation.

```
devcon /r enable '*PNP0000
```

In response, DevCon enables the device and then reboots the system to make the enabling effective.

When the system starts, use a DevCon status command to confirm that the device is enabled.

```

The following command enables all printer devices on the computer by specifying the Printer setup class in a [**DevCon Enable**](devcon-enable.md) command. The command includes the **/r** parameter, which reboots the system if it is necessary to make the enabling effective.

```
devcon /r enable =Printer
```

In response, DevCon displays the device instance ID of the printer that it found in the Printer class and reports that it is enabled. Although the command included the **/r** parameter, the system did not reboot because a reboot was not required to enable the printer.

The following command uses the [**DevCon Disable**](devcon-disable.md) operation to disable the USB devices on the local computer. It identifies the devices by a hardware ID pattern (USB\*). This pattern will match any device whose hardware ID or compatible ID begins with "USB." The command includes the **/r** parameter, which reboots the system if it is necessary to make the disabling effective.

**Note**   Before using an ID pattern to disable a device, determine which devices will be affected. To do so, use the pattern in a display command, such as **devcon status USB\\*** or **devcon hwids USB\\***.

 

```
devcon /r disable USB*
```

In response, DevCon displays the device instance IDs of the USB devices and reports that they are disabled. Although the command included the **/r** parameter, the system did not reboot because a reboot was not required to disable the devices.

The following command uses the [**DevCon Disable**](devcon-disable.md) operation to disable the USB devices on the local computer. This command identifies the devices by their device instance IDs as indicated by the at character (**@**) that precedes each ID. Each device instance ID is separated from the others by a space.

Also, because the device instance IDs include the ampersand character (**&**), they are enclosed in quotation marks. The command includes the **/r** parameter, which reboots the system if it is necessary to make the disabling effective.

The following command uses the [**DevCon Update**](devcon-update.md) operation to replace the current device driver for communication ports on the system with a test driver specified in the test.inf file. The command affects only devices whose entire hardware ID is \*PNP0501 (including the asterisk).

You can use this command to replace signed drivers on the system with alternate drivers for testing or troubleshooting, or to associate the devices with the newest version of the same drivers.

```
devcon update c:\windows\inf\test.inf *PNP0501
```

In response, DevCon displays a **Hardware Installation** warning explaining that the driver has not passed Windows Logo testing. If you click the **Continue Anyway** button on the dialog box, the installation continues.

Then, DevCon displays the following success message.

```
Updating drivers for *PNP0501 from c:\windows\inf\test.inf.
Drivers updated successfully.
```

You can also use the [**DevCon UpdateNI**](devcon-updateni.md) operation, the noninteractive version of the **DevCon Update** operation, to update drivers. The **DevCon UpdateNI** operation is identical to the **DevCon Update** operation except that it suppresses all user prompts that require a response and assumes the default response to the prompt.

The following command uses the **DevCon UpdateNI** operation to install the test driver.

```
devcon updateni c:\windows\inf\test.inf *PNP0501
```

In this case, DevCon does not display the **Hardware Installation** warning. Instead, it assumes the default response, **Stop Installation**. As a result, DevCon cannot update the drivers and displays a failure message.

```

The following example shows how to install the Microsoft Loopback Adapter during an unattended installation of Microsoft Windows XP.

To install this device during an unattended setup, begin by adding the following files to a floppy disk: devcon.exe and netloop.inf (C:\\Windows\\inf\\netloop.inf).

Then, to the **\[GUIRunOnce\]** section of the unattended setup file, add the following DevCon command:

```
a:\devcon /r install a:\Netloop.inf '*MSLOOP
```

This command identifies the loopback adapter by using its hardware ID, \*MSLOOP. The single quote character preceding "\*MSLOOP" tells DevCon to interpret the string literally, that is, to interpret the asterisk as part of the hardware ID, not as a wildcard character.

The command also specifies that DevCon use the Netloop.inf file (on the floppy disk) in the installation. The **/r** parameter reboots the computer only if a reboot is necessary to complete the installation.

Finally, add network configuration settings to the unattended setup file and run the unattended setup.

The following command uses the [**DevCon Remove**](devcon-remove.md) operation to remove all USB devices from the computer. It identifies the devices by a device instance ID pattern that matches any device instance ID (registry path) that begins with the "USB\\" string. The at character (**@**) distinguishes the device instance ID from a hardware ID or compatible ID. The command also includes the **/r** parameter that reboots the system if it is required to make the remove procedure effective.

**Warning**   Before removing any devices by using a pattern, determine which devices are affected. To do so, use the pattern in a display command, such as <strong>devcon status @usb\\\</strong>* or <strong>devcon hwids @usb\\\</strong>*.

 

```
devcon /r remove @usb\*

The following command uses the [**DevCon Restart**](devcon-restart.md) operation to restart the loopback adapter on the local computer. The command limits the search to the Net setup class and, within that class, specifies the device instance ID of the loopback adapter, **ROOT\\\*MSLOOP\\0000**. The at character (**@**) identifies the string as an device instance ID. The single quote character (**'**), which requests a literal search, prevents DevCon from interpreting the asterisk in the ID as a wildcard character.

```
devcon restart =net @'ROOT\*MSLOOP\0000
```

In response, DevCon displays the device instance ID of the device and reports the result.

```

The following command uses the [**DevCon Reboot**](devcon-reboot.md) operation to reboot the operating system on the local computer and to associate the reboot with a hardware installation. Unlike the **/r** parameter, the **DevCon Reboot** operation does not depend on the return code from another operation.

You can include this command in scripts and batch files that require the system to reboot.

```
devcon reboot
```

In response, DevCon displays a message indicating that it is restarting the computer (Rebooting local machine).


DevCon uses the standard **ExitWindowsEx** function to reboot. If the user has open files on the computer or a program will not close, the system does not reboot until the user has responded to system prompts to close the files or end the process.

The following command uses the [**DevCon SetHwID**](devcon-sethwid.md) operation to assign the hardware ID, beep, to the legacy beep device.

The command uses the device instance ID of the device, ROOT\\LEGACY\_BEEP\\0000, because the beep legacy device has no hardware IDs or compatible IDs. It uses the at character (**@**) to indicate that the string is a device instance ID.

The command does not use any symbol parameters to position the ID. By default, DevCon adds new hardware IDs to the end of a hardware ID list. In this case, because the device has no other hardware IDs, placement is irrelevant.

```
devcon sethwid @ROOT\LEGACY_BEEP\0000 := beep
```

In response, DevCon displays a message indicating that it is added beep to the hardware ID list for the device. It also displays the resulting hardware ID list. In this case, there is only one hardware ID in the list.

The command uses the **-** symbol parameter to add the new hardware ID to the end of the hardware ID list for the device, in case a preferred hardware ID has been created for one of the devices. It uses the **/m** parameter to specify the remote computer. It also uses a device instance ID pattern, <strong>@ROOT\\LEGACY\</strong><em>, to identify the legacy devices on the computer, that is, all devices whose device instance ID begins with **ROOT\\LEGACY</em>*.

```
devcon /m:\\Server1 sethwid @ROOT\LEGACY* := -legacy
```

In response, DevCon displays the resulting hardware ID lists for all affected devices.

```
ROOT\LEGACY_AFD\0000                                        : legacy
ROOT\LEGACY_BEEP\0000                                    : beep,legacy
ROOT\LEGACY_CRCDISK\0000                                    : legacy
ROOT\LEGACY_DMBOOT\0000                                     : legacy
ROOT\LEGACY_DMLOAD\0000                                     : legacy
ROOT\LEGACY_FIPS\0000                                       : legacy
...
ROOT\LEGACY_WANARP\0000                                     : legacy
Modified 27 hardware ID(s).
```

After you assign the same hardware ID to a group of devices, you can use the other DevCon operations to view and change the devices in a single command.

For example, the following command displays the status of all legacy devices.

```
devcon status legacy
```

The following command uses the [**DevCon SetHwID**](devcon-sethwid.md) operation to delete the hardware ID, **legacy**, from the list of hardware IDs for all legacy devices on the Server1 remote computer.

The command uses the **/m** parameter to specify the remote computer. It uses the hardware ID, **legacy**, to identify all devices that have that hardware ID. Then, it uses the **!** symbol parameter to delete the **legacy** hardware ID.

```
devcon /m:\\Server1 sethwid legacy := !legacy
```

In response, DevCon displays the resulting hardware ID lists for all affected devices.

```
ROOT\LEGACY_AFD\0000                                        :

The following series of examples shows how to use the varied features of the [**DevCon SetHwID**](devcon-sethwid.md) operation.

This series uses a fictitious device, DeviceX, with the device instance ID, **ROOT\\DeviceX\\0000**. Before using DevCon, the device had the following list of hardware IDs:

```
Hw3 Hw4
```

The following command uses the **+** symbol to add **Hw1** and **Hw2** to the beginning of a list of hardware IDs for DeviceX. Because **Hw2** already appears in the list, it is moved, not added. The command identifies the device by its device instance ID, as indicated by the at character (**@**) preceding the ID.

```
devcon sethwid @ROOT\DEVICEX\0000 := +Hw1 Hw2
```

In response, DevCon displays the new hardware ID list for the device. Note that **Hw1** and **Hw2** appear at the beginning of the list in the specified order.

```
ROOT\DEVICEX\0000                         : Hw1,Hw2,Hw3,Hw4
Modified 1 hardware ID(s).
```

Also, DevCon reports that it modified one hardware ID list, that is, the hardware ID list of one device.

The following command uses the **!** symbol to delete the **Hw1** hardware ID. It then lists the hardware ID, **Hw5**, without a symbol parameter. Without symbol parameters, SetHwID adds the hardware ID to the end of the hardware ID list for the device.

This command demonstrates that, unlike the other symbol parameters for the **DevCon SetHwID** operation, the **!** symbol applies only to the hardware ID that it prefixes.

```
devcon sethwid @ROOT\DeviceX\0000 := !Hw1 Hw5
```

In response, DevCon displays the resulting hardware ID list for DeviceX.

```
ROOT\DEVICEX\0000                         : Hw2,Hw3,Hw4,Hw5
Modified 1 hardware ID(s).
```

The following command uses the = parameter to replace all hardware IDs in the list for DeviceX with a single hardware ID, **DevX**.

```
devcon sethwid @ROOT\DeviceX\0000 := =DevX
```

In response, DevCon displays the resulting hardware ID list for DeviceX.

```
ROOT\DEVICEX\0000                         : DevX
Modified 1 hardware ID(s).
```

The success message indicates that DevCon modified the hardware ID of one device.

### <span id="ddk_example_44_forcibly_update_the_hal_tools"></span><span id="DDK_EXAMPLE_44_FORCIBLY_UPDATE_THE_HAL_TOOLS"></span><a name="ddk_example_44_forcibly_update_the_hal_tools"></a>Example 44: Forcibly update the HAL

The following example shows how to use DevCon to update the HAL on the computer. In this example, a tester wants to replace the uniprocessor APCI APIC HAL that is best suited to the computer with a multiprocessor APCI APIC HAL for testing purposes.

The first command uses the [**DevCon SetHwID**](devcon-sethwid.md) operation to change the hardware ID of the HAL from **acpiapic\_up**, the hardware ID for uniprocessor HALs, to **acpiapic\_mp**, the hardware ID for multiprocessor HALs.

You must change the hardware ID because the INF file for the HAL includes drivers for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor HALs. The system selects the most appropriate driver from the INF file based on the hardware ID of the device. If you do not change the hardware ID, then the **DevCon Update** command would simply reinstall the uniprocessor HAL driver.

In the following command, the command identifies the HAL by its instance ID, **ROOT\\ACPI\_HAL\\0000**, as indicated by the **@** character preceding the ID. The command uses the **+** character to make **acpiapic\_mp** the first hardware ID in the list for the HAL. Then, it uses the **!** character to delete the **acpiapic\_up** hardware ID from the list of IDs for the HAL.

```
devcon sethwid @ROOT\ACPI_HAL\0000 := +acpiapic_mp !acpiapic_up
```

In response, DevCon displays the following new hardware ID list for the HAL.

```
ROOT\ACPI_HAL\0000                         : acpiapic_mp
Modified 1 hardware ID(s).
```

The following command uses the [**DevCon Update**](devcon-update.md) operation to update the driver for the HAL.

```
devcon update c:\windows\inf\hal.inf acpiapic_mp
```

Then, DevCon displays the following success message.

```
Updating drivers for acpiapic_mp from c:\windows\inf\hal.inf.
Drivers updated successfully.
```
