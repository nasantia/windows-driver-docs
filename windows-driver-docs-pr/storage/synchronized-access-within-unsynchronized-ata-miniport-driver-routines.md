# Synchronized Access within ATA Miniport Driver Routines

**NOTE** The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the [Storport driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver) and [Storport miniport](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers) driver models.


Even when an ATA miniport driver does unsynchronized processing of I/O requests in its [**IdeHwBuildIo**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/irb/nc-irb-ide_hw_buildio) routine, it can synchronize access to critical system structures by calling [**AtaPortRequestSynchronizedRoutine**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/irb/nf-irb-ataportrequestsynchronizedroutine). This routine resembles the [**StorPortSynchronizeAccess**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportsynchronizeaccess) routine that is provided in the Storport I/O model. For more information about how Storport miniport drivers manage synchronized access of critical data structures, see [Synchronized Access within Unsynchronized Miniport Driver Routines](synchronized-access-within-unsynchronized-miniport-driver-routines.md).

When an ATA miniport driver calls **AtaPortRequestSynchronizedRoutine**, it must supply a pointer to a callback routine. The callback routine processes the part of the I/O request that must be synchronized with the interrupt handler. For better performance, write your driver to spend as little time as possible to execute the callback routine.
