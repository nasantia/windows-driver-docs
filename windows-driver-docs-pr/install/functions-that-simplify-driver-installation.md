# Functions that Simplify Driver Installation


An installation application can use the following functions to simplify the installation of a PnP function driver.

### <a href="" id="diinstalldevice--windows-vista-and-later-versions-of-windows-"></a> DiInstallDevice (Windows Vista and later versions of Windows)

The [**DiInstallDevice**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/newdev/nf-newdev-diinstalldevice) function installs a specific driver that is preinstalled in the [driver store](driver-store.md) on a specific device present in the system.

An installation application should only use this function if both of the following are true:

-   The application incorporates more than one device instance of the same type, that is, all the device instances have the same hardware IDs and compatible IDs.

-   The application requires that device-instance-specific drivers be installed on the device instances.

Otherwise, an installation application should use [**DiInstallDriver**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/newdev/nf-newdev-diinstalldrivera) or [**UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/newdev/nf-newdev-updatedriverforplugandplaydevicesa) to install the driver that is the best match for a device.

A caller can also call **DiInstallDevice** to do the following:

-   Search for a preinstalled driver that is the best match to the device, and if one is not found, display the Found New Hardware wizard for the device.

-   Suppress invoking finish-install pages and finish-install actions.

-   Install a null driver on a specific device.

-   Notify the caller whether a system restart is required to complete the installation.

### <a href="" id="diinstalldriver--windows-vista-and-later-versions-of-windows-"></a> DiInstallDriver (Windows Vista and later versions of Windows)

The [**DiInstallDriver**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/newdev/nf-newdev-diinstalldrivera) function preinstalls a [driver package](driver-packages.md) in the [driver store](driver-store.md) and then installs the driver on all devices present in the system that have a hardware ID or a compatible ID that matches the driver package.

Calling **DiInstallDriver** or [**UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/newdev/nf-newdev-updatedriverforplugandplaydevicesa) is the simplest way for an installation application to install a new driver for a device. **DiInstallDriver** and **UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices** perform the same basic installation operations. However **UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices** supports additional installation options.

By default, **DiInstallDriver** only installs the driver on a device if the driver is a better match to the device than the driver that is currently installed on the device. For information about how Windows selects a driver for device, see [How Windows Selects Drivers](how-setup-selects-drivers.md).

A caller can also call **DiInstallDriver** to do the following:

-   Force the installation of the specified driver regardless of whether the driver is a better match to the device than the driver that is currently installed on the device.

    **Caution**   Forcing the installation of the driver can result in replacing a more compatible or newer driver with a less compatible or older driver.

     

-   Indicate to the caller whether a system restart is required to complete the installation.

### <a href="" id="dirollbackdriver--windows-vista-and-later-versions-of-windows-"></a> DiRollbackDriver (Windows Vista and later versions of Windows)

The [**DiRollbackDriver**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/newdev/nf-newdev-dirollbackdriver) function replaces the driver that is currently installed on a device with the previously installed backup driver that is set for a device. This function is provided primarily to restore a device to a working condition if a device fails after updating the driver for the device. This function performs the same operation that would be performed if a user clicked **Roll Back Driver** on the Driver page for the device in Device Manager.

Windows maintains at most one backup driver for a device. Windows sets a driver as the backup driver for a device immediately after the driver is successfully installed on the device and Windows determines that the device is functioning correctly. However, if a driver does not install successfully on a device or the device does not function correctly after the installation, Windows does not set the driver as the backup driver for the device.

A caller can also call **DiRollbackDriver** to do the following:

-   Suppress the display of any user interface component that is associated with the driver rollback.

-   Indicate to the caller whether a system restart is required to complete the installation.

For more information about driver rollback, see information about Device Manager in Help and Support Center.

### <a href="" id="updatedriverforplugandplaydevices"></a> UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices

The [**UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/newdev/nf-newdev-updatedriverforplugandplaydevicesa) function installs the driver on all devices present in the system that have a hardware ID or compatible ID that matches the driver package.

Calling this function or [**DiInstallDriver**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/newdev/nf-newdev-diinstalldrivera) is the simplest way for an installation application to install a new driver that is the best match for devices in the system. The basic operation of **UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices** is similar to the operation of **DiInstallDriver**. However **UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices** supports additional installation options.

By default, **UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices** only installs the driver on a device if the driver is a better match to the device than the driver that is currently installed on a device.

A caller can also optionally call **UpdateDriverForPlugAndPlayDevices** to do the following:

-   Force the installation of the specified driver regardless of whether the driver is a better match to the device than the driver that is currently installed on the device.

    **Caution**   Forcing the installation of the driver can result in replacing a more compatible or newer driver with a less compatible or older driver.

     

-   Suppress copying, renaming, or deleting installation files.

-   Suppress the display of user interface components.

-   Indicate to the caller whether a system restart is required to complete the installation.
