# Using Serial.sys and Serenum.sys

The following system components are available for use with serial controller devices that have hardware interfaces that are compatible with the 16550 universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART):

-   Serial and Serenum drivers

    Serial.sys (Serial) is a system-supplied function driver for serial devices. You can also use Serial as a lower-level device filter driver for any type of Plug and Play device that requires a 16550 UART-compatible interface.

    Serenum.sys (Serenum) is a system-supplied upper-level device filter driver that you can use in conjunction with Serial (or a vendor-supplied function driver) to provide the function of a Plug and Play bus driver for an RS-232 port.

    For more information about the operation of Serial and Serenum, see the following topics:

- Ports [device setup class](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/device-setup-classes)

    The Ports class includes *serial ports* and *COM ports*. A serial port is a serial communication hardware interface on a 16550 UART or compatible device. An RS-232 port on a computer is typically a DB-9 or DB-25 connector that is electrically connected to the serial port on a UART. A COM port is a serial port that complies with additional Windows-specific requirements. For more information, see [Configuration of COM Ports](configuration-of-com-ports.md).

- COM port [device interface class](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/device-interface-classes)

    You must use a COM port device interface to access a COM port. (The GUID for the COM port device interface class is [**GUID\_DEVINTERFACE\_COMPORT**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/guid-devinterface-comport).)

- [COM port database](com-port-database.md) and [COM port database support routines](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index)

    The COM port database arbitrates the use of COM port numbers by COM ports.

For general information about the high-level operation of a serial device, see the information about the communications resources that are supported by the Windows Base Services in the Microsoft Windows SDK.

## Serial driver samples

These samples demonstrates serial drivers.

- The [Serial](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617962) sample builds a function driver for serial devices.
- The [Serenum](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617961) sample provides Plug and Play functionality of a bus driver for an RS-232 port.
- A simple virtual serial driver (ComPort) and a controller-less modem driver (FakeModem).
