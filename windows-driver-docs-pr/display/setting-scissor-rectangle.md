# Setting Scissor Rectangle


## <span id="ddk_setting_scissor_rectangle_gg"></span><span id="DDK_SETTING_SCISSOR_RECTANGLE_GG"></span>


A DirectX 9.0 version driver must support setting a rectangular clipping region, that is, a scissor rectangle. After this scissor rectangle is set, rendering is restricted to just the portion of the render target that is specified by the scissor rectangle. To set a scissor rectangle, the driver must process the D3DDP2OP\_SETSCISSORRECT operation code in its [**D3dDrawPrimitives2**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb) function. A RECT structure that specifies the rectangular clipping region follows the operation code in the [command stream](command-stream.md).
