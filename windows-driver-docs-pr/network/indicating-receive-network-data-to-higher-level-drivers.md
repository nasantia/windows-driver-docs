# Indicating Receive Network Data to Higher Level Drivers





A connectionless intermediate driver indicates receive network data to the next higher driver by calling the [**NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismindicatereceivenetbufferlists) function. A connection-oriented intermediate driver indicates receive network data to the next higher driver by calling the [**NdisMCoIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismcoindicatereceivenetbufferlists) function.

Before indicating the receive network data, the driver processes the data, perhaps converting it to the format expected by a higher-level driver, and if required, copying relevant data into MDLs that are associated with an intermediate-driver-allocated [**NET\_BUFFER**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_net_buffer) structure.
