# Example: Passing the IRP Down Without Setting a Completion Routine

To pass the IRP down to lower-level drivers without setting a completion routine, a dispatch routine must do the following:

-   Call [**IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/mm-bad-pointer) to remove the current IRP stack location, so that the I/O Manager will not look for a completion routine there when it performs completion processing on the IRP.

-   Call [**IoCallDriver**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocalldriver) to pass the IRP down to the next lower-level driver.

This technique is illustrated in the following code examples:

```cpp
IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation ( Irp ); 
return IoCallDriver ( NextLowerDriverDeviceObject, Irp ); 
```

Or, equivalently:

```cpp
IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation ( Irp ); 
status = IoCallDriver ( NextLowerDriverDeviceObject, Irp ); 
/* log or debugprint the status value here */
return status; 
```

In these examples, the first parameter in the call to [**IoCallDriver**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocalldriver) is a pointer to the next-lower-level filter driver's device object. The second parameter is a pointer to the IRP.

The technique shown above (calling [**IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/mm-bad-pointer)) is simple and efficient and should be used in all cases where the driver passes the IRP down the driver stack without registering a completion routine.

After [**IoCallDriver**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocalldriver) is called, the IRP pointer that was passed to **IoCallDriver** is no longer valid and cannot safely be dereferenced. If the driver needs to perform further processing or cleanup after the IRP has been processed by lower-level drivers, it must set a completion routine before sending the IRP down the driver stack. For more information about writing and setting completion routines, see [Using Completion Routines](using-irp-completion-routines.md).

If you call [**IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/mm-bad-pointer) for an IRP, you cannot set a completion routine for it.
