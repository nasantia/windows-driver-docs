When the driver's [**Cancel**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_cancel) routine exits, the value of the **Irp-&gt;CancelIrql** member is not the current IRQL. Typically, this error occurs when the driver does not call [**IoReleaseCancelSpinLock**](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff549550(v=vs.85)) with the IRQL that was supplied by the most recent call to [**IoAcquireCancelSpinLock**](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff548196(v=vs.85)).

For more information about *Cancel* routines, see [Canceling IRPs](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/canceling-irps).
