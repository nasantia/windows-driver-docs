# Page Event Callbacks





When a user interacts with a property sheet page, the operation system sends notification of such window events as a changed focus or a modified value. How a CPSUI application receives notification of a page's window events depends on how the application has defined the page:

-   If the page was defined using [CPSUI-supplied pages and templates](cpsui-supplied-pages-and-templates.md), it can supply a [CPSUI message handler](cpsui-message-handler.md).

-   If the application created a customized page that is not supplied by CPSUI, it must provide a dialog box procedure. For more information, see [Dialog Box Procedures and CPSUI](dialog-box-procedures-and-cpsui.md).

A CPSUI application supplies CPSUI with the address of a page event callback when it calls the [**ComPropSheet**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/compstui/nc-compstui-pfncompropsheet) function.
