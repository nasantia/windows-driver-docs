# Access PCMCIA Attribute Memory by Using a PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface





This section describes how a driver can use a PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD interface to access attribute memory.

The PCMCIA interface standard is provided primarily for memory card drivers and file systems.

A driver can use the [**PCMCIA\_MODIFY\_MEMORY\_WINDOW**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddpcm/nc-ntddpcm-pcmcia_modify_memory_window) interface routine supported by the PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD interface. PCMCIA\_MODIFY\_MEMORY\_WINDOW sets the attributes of a memory window for a PCMCIA memory card. The memory window is mapped by the PCMCIA bus driver. Note that this routine does not provide a permanent window, it only modifies the current settings for an existing window. In addition, settings are not persistent over a change in the system power state.

For more information, see [PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface for Memory Cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/pcmcia/pcmcia-interface-standard-interface-for-memory-cards).
