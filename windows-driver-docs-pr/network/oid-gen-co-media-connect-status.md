# OID_GEN_CO_MEDIA_CONNECT_STATUS

The OID_GEN_CO_MEDIA_CONNECT_STATUS OID requests the miniport driver to return the connection status of the NIC on the network as one of the following system-defined values:

**NdisMediaStateConnected**

**NdisMediaStateDisconnected**

When a miniport driver senses that the network connection has been lost, it should call [NdisMCoIndicateStatus](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndismcoindicatestatusex) with NDIS_STATUS_MEDIA_DISCONNECT. When the connection is restored, it should call NdisMCoIndicateStatus with NDIS_STATUS_MEDIA_CONNECT.
