# Revise Canceled Request Logic


When an I/O request is canceled, a WDM driver must manage several difficult race conditions. A request might be canceled while it is in a queue or while the driver is processing it. In each case the driver must use a combination of locks to ensure that it cancels and completes the request only once.

The WDF queuing mechanism greatly simplifies cancellation. If a request is canceled while it is on a queue, the framework handles cancellation without notifying the driver. The driver can request notification by registering an [*EvtIoCanceledOnQueue*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfio/nc-wdfio-evt_wdf_io_queue_io_canceled_on_queue) callback function. After the framework has delivered a request to the driver, the request is not cancelable by default. A driver can call [**WdfRequestIsCanceled**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfrequest/nf-wdfrequest-wdfrequestiscanceled) at any time to find out whether the request has been canceled.
