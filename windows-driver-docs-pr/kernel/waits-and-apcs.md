# Waits and APCs





Threads that wait for a dispatcher object on behalf of a user-mode caller must be prepared for that wait to be interrupted, either by a user APC or by thread termination. When a thread calls [**KeWaitForSingleObject**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kewaitforsingleobject), [**KeWaitForMultipleObjects**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kewaitformultipleobjects), [**KeWaitForMutexObject**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff553344), or [**KeDelayExecutionThread**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kedelayexecutionthread), the operating system can place the thread in a wait state. Typically, the thread remains in the wait state until the operating system can complete the operation that the caller requests. However, if the caller specifies *WaitMode* = UserMode, the operating system might interrupt the wait. In that case, the routine exits with an NTSTATUS value of STATUS\_USER\_APC.

Any driver that calls one of the preceding four routines with *WaitMode* = UserMode must be prepared to receive a return value of STATUS\_USER\_APC. The driver must complete its current operation with STATUS\_USER\_APC and return control to user mode.

The exact situations in which the operating system interrupts the wait depends on the value of the *Alertable* parameter of the routine. If *Alertable* = **TRUE**, the wait is an alertable wait. Otherwise, the wait is a non-alertable wait. The operating system interrupts alertable waits only to deliver a user APC. The operating system interrupts both kinds of waits to terminate the thread.

The following table explains the relationship between different parameter settings, waits, and user APC delivery.

You can disable kernel APCs for a thread. If you do disable kernel APCs for a thread, both user APC delivery and thread termination for that thread are also disabled. For more information about how to disable APCs, see [Disabling APCs](disabling-apcs.md).

Alerts, a seldom-used mechanism that are internal to the operating system, can also interrupt alertable wait states. An alert can interrupt a wait when *Alertable* = **TRUE**, regardless of the value of the *WaitMode* parameter. The waiting routine returns a value of STATUS\_ALERTED.

Note that kernel APCs run preemptively, and do not cause **KeWaitFor*Xxx*** or **KeDelayExecutionThread** to return. The system interrupts and resumes the wait internally. Drivers are normally unaffected by this process, but it is possible for the driver to miss a dispatcher object signal for a transient condition, such as a call to [**KePulseEvent**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-kepulseevent).
