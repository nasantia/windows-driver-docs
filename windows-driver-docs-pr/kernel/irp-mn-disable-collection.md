# IRP\_MN\_DISABLE\_COLLECTION


Any WMI driver that registers one or more of its data blocks as expensive to collect must handle this IRP. A driver can handle WMI IRPs either by calling [**WmiSystemControl**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmilib/nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol) or by handling the IRP itself, as described in [Handling WMI Requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/handling-wmi-requests).

If a driver calls [**WmiSystemControl**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmilib/nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol) to handle an **IRP\_MN\_DISABLE\_COLLECTION** request, WMI in turn calls that driver's [*DpWmiFunctionControl*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmilib/nc-wmilib-wmi_function_control_callback) routine.

Major Code
----------

[**IRP\_MJ\_SYSTEM\_CONTROL**](irp-mj-system-control.md)
When Sent
---------

WMI sends this IRP to request the driver to stop accumulating data for a data block that the driver registered as expensive to collect and for which data collection has been enabled.

WMI sends this IRP at IRQL = PASSIVE\_LEVEL in an arbitrary thread context.

## Input Parameters


**Parameters.WMI.ProviderId** points to the device object of the driver that should respond to the request. This pointer is located in the driver's I/O stack location in the IRP.

**Parameters.WMI.DataPath** points to a GUID that identifies the data block for which data accumulation should be stopped.

## Output Parameters


None.

## I/O Status Block


If the driver handles the IRP by calling [**WmiSystemControl**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmilib/nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol), WMI sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** and **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Information** in the I/O status block.

Otherwise, the driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_SUCCESS or to an appropriate error status such as the following:

STATUS\_WMI\_GUID\_NOT\_FOUND

STATUS\_INVALID\_DEVICE\_REQUEST

On success, a driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Information** to zero.

Operation
---------

A driver registers a data block as expensive to collect by setting WMIREG\_FLAG\_EXPENSIVE in the **Flags** member of the [**WMIREGGUID**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmistr/ns-wmistr-wmiregguidw) or [**WMIGUIDREGINFO**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmilib/ns-wmilib-_wmiguidreginfo) structure that the driver passes to WMI when it registers or updates the data block. A driver need not accumulate data for such a block until it receives an explicit request to enable collection.

If a driver handles WMI IRPs by calling [**WmiSystemControl**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmilib/nf-wmilib-wmisystemcontrol), that routine calls the driver's [*DpWmiFunctionControl*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmilib/nc-wmilib-wmi_function_control_callback) routine, or returns STATUS\_SUCCESS if the driver does not define the routine.

If a driver handles an **IRP\_MN\_DISABLE\_COLLECTION** request itself, it should do so only if **Parameters.WMI.ProviderId** points to the same device object as the pointer that the driver passed to [**IoWMIRegistrationControl**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iowmiregistrationcontrol). Otherwise, the driver must forward the request to the next-lower driver.

Before handling the request, the driver must determine whether **Parameters.WMI.DataPath** points to a GUID that the driver supports. If not, the driver must fail the IRP and return STATUS\_WMI\_GUID\_NOT\_FOUND. If the data block is valid but was not registered with WMIREG\_FLAG\_EXPENSIVE, the driver can return STATUS\_SUCCESS and take no further action.

It is unnecessary for the driver to check whether data collection is already disabled because WMI sends a single disable request for the data block when the last data consumer disables collection for that block. WMI will not send another disable request without an intervening request to enable.
