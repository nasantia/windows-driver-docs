# PackageInfo XML schema overview

[!include[MBAE deprecation warning](mbae-deprecation-warning.md)]

A metadata package contains one PackageInfo.xml document, which has information that the operating system uses to install the metadata package and reference its contents.

The data in the PackageInfo.xml document is formatted based on the PackageInfo XML schema, which is described in this section.

**Note**  
The XML document must be saved by using UTF-8 encoding.

 

For the complete definition of the PackageInfo XML schema, see [PackageInfo XML schema definition](packageinfo-xml-schema-definition.md).

For information about the data types that are defined by the PackageInfo XML schema, see [PackageInfo XML data types](packageinfo-xml-data-types.md).
