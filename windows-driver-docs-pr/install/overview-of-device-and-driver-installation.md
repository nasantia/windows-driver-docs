# Overview of Device and Driver Installation

The Windows operating system installs devices when the system restarts or when a user plugs in (or manually installs) a Plug and Play (PnP) device.

Specifically, Windows enumerates the devices that are present in the system and loads and calls the drivers for each device.

Drivers such as the ACPI driver and other PnP [bus drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/bus-drivers) help Windows determine which devices are present.
