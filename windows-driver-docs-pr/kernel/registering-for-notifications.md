# Registering for Notifications


To filter registry calls, your kernel-mode registry filtering driver must first call [**CmRegisterCallback**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-cmregistercallback) or [**CmRegisterCallbackEx**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-cmregistercallbackex) to register a [**RegistryCallback**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-ex_callback_function) routine. (For Windows Vista and later operating system versions, drivers should use **CmRegisterCallbackEx** instead of **CmRegisterCallback**.)

After your driver has registered a *RegistryCallback* routine, the configuration manager calls the routine each time that a thread attempts to perform a registry operation. Threads that perform registry operations can be from user-mode applications that call the user-mode registry routines (**RegCreateKeyEx**, **RegOpenKeyEx**, and so on) and from drivers that call the kernel-mode registry routines ([**ZwCreateKey**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-zwcreatekey), [**ZwOpenKey**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-zwopenkey), and so on).

For most operations, your driver can receive notification before the configuration manager processes the registry operation (a *pre-notification*) or immediately after the operation completes (but before the configuration manager returns to the callerâ€”a *post-notification*). For a list of the types of notifications that your driver can receive, see [**REG\_NOTIFY\_CLASS**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ne-wdm-_reg_notify_class).

After a driver has called **CmRegisterCallback** or **CmRegisterCallbackEx**, the driver will receive notifications until it calls [**CmUnRegisterCallback**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-cmunregistercallback) or is unloaded.
