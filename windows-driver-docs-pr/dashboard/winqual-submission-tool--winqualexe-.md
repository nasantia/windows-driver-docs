# Winqual Submission Tool (winqual.exe)


The Winqual Submission Tool (Winqual.exe) helps you to create a submission package for Microsoft Windows Hardware Certification. The tool collects information about the type of submission prepared, and gathers all the logs, drivers, and symbols required for submission.

In addition, the use of Winqual.exe is applicable only to WLK.

## Installing the Winqual submission tool

2.  On the left navigation menu, click on **Drivers**. At the bottom of the page, in the **Get the essentials** section, click **Winqual Submission Tool (WST)**.

3.  In the **File Download - Security Warning** dialog box, click **Run**.

4.  In the **Internet Explorer - Security Warning** dialog box, click **Run**.

5.  On the **Welcome** screen, click **Next**.

6.  On the **License Agreement** screen, select **I agree** and click **Next**.

To use the Windows Submission Tool (WST):

1.  When you open the tool, a **Welcome** screen appears. You can choose to not show this dialog box next time you open the tool by selecting **Don't show this message again**. To re-enable this dialog box, click **Tools**, click **Options**, and then select the **Show Welcome screen on startup** check box.

2.  The main screen appears, where test results and drivers can be added for creating the submission package.

3.  If a new version of WST is available, you'll receive a prompt to install the new version.

4.  If the version check fails, you'll receive a warning message, which can be disabled by selecting the **Don't show this message again** check box.

    **Note**  
    To re-enable this dialog box, click **Tools**, click **Options**, and then select the **Warn if update check fails** check box.

     

5.  Add the test results to the submission package, and choose to save the list for later use. An **.xml** file (which you'll use later for creating the submission) is created with all the submission information.

6.  You can save the file with a different file name by using the **Save As** menu item or toolbar button.

7.  Saved files are added to the **Recent Files** menu.

You can also perform the following additional actions in the WST:

-   You can start a new submission by clicking the **New** menu item or toolbar button.

-   A file saved earlier can be opened using the **Open** menu item or toolbar button. A file in **Recent Files** can also be opened by clicking the menu item.

-   Entries from the list can be removed individually by clicking the **Remove** button, or all at once by clicking **Remove All**.

-   An optional Read-me file (**.docx**, **.doc**, or **.txt**) file can be placed in the submission package.

You can fix errors by editing the entry and updating the driver or the test result.

7.  After all of the errors are fixed, you can create a submission package. The submission package is created with the same name as the .xml file at the same location.
