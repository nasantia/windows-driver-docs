Resolution
----------

The [**!analyze**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-analyze) debug extension displays information about the bug check and can be helpful in determining the root cause. 

Running the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool could be useful as well to exclude any kind of problem affecting the physical memory modules.
