warning: C28114: Copying a whole IRP stack entry leaves certain fields initialized that should be cleared or updated.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />

</colgroup>

The driver is copying an IRP improperly. Improperly copying an IRP can cause serious problems with a driver, including loss of data and system crashes. If an IRP must be copied and [**IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocopycurrentirpstacklocationtonext) does not suffice, then certain members of the IRP should not be copied or should be zeroed after copying.
