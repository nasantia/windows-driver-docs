# Retreat and Advance Operations





NDIS provides retreat and advance functions to manipulate [**NET\_BUFFER**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_net_buffer) structures. [Retreat operations](retreat-operations.md) make more *used data space* available to the current driver. [Advance operations](advance-operations.md) release *used data space*.

Retreat operations are required during send operations or when a driver returns received data to an underlying driver. For example, during a send operation, a driver can call the [**NdisRetreatNetBufferDataStart**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisretreatnetbufferdatastart) function to make room for header data.

Advance operations are required when a send operation is complete or when a driver receives data from an underlying driver. For example, during a receive operation, a driver can call the [**NdisAdvanceNetBufferDataStart**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisadvancenetbufferdatastart) function to skip over the header data that was used by a lower level driver. In this case, the header data remains in the buffer in the *unused data space*.

The following figure shows the relationship between the network data and these operations.
