# Calling a PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface Routine





This section describes how to call a PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD interface routine.

After a driver obtains an [PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD Interface Memory Card Routines](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index) structure from the PCMCIA bus driver, the driver can call the interface routines.

Each interface routine requires a context pointer. The driver must use the **Context** member value returned by the PCMCIA bus driver in the PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD structure. If the context pointer is not valid, the system behavior is not defined, and the system might halt.

The PCMCIA\_INTERFACE\_STANDARD interface routines can be called at IRQL &lt;= DISPATCH\_LEVEL. To maintain overall system performance, it is strongly recommended that a driver call these routines at IRQL &lt; DISPATCH\_LEVEL. Calling an interface routine at IRQL DISPATCH\_LEVEL can cause the caller to block system operation for a significant period of time.
