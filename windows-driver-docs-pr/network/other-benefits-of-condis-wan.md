# Other Benefits of CoNDIS WAN





In addition to flexibility and simplicity, the CoNDIS WAN model provides the following benefits:

-   CoNDIS WAN miniport drivers support multipacket [send and receive operations](sending-and-receiving-data.md).

-   When a CoNDIS miniport driver indicates a receive packet, a bound protocol can defer processing of the packet. When an NDIS WAN miniport driver indicates a receive packet, a bound protocol must copy the data immediately.

-   CoNDIS WAN supports multipoint calls. For more information about making multipoint calls, see [Making a Call](making-a-call.md).

-   CoNDIS WAN supports quality of service (QoS). CoNDIS WAN drivers use the [**NET\_BUFFER**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_net_buffer) structure. For more information about CoNDIS QoS, see [Client-Initiated Request to Change Call Parameters](client-initiated-request-to-change-call-parameters.md).

-   Only CoNDIS WAN will support future NDIS enhancements that apply to WAN drivers.
