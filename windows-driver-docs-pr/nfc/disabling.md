# Disabling NFP


A client can temporarily disable subscriptions, publications, and presence.

Temporarily disabling subscriptions, publications, and presence is done by sending [**IOCTL\_NFP\_DISABLE**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/nfpdev/ni-nfpdev-ioctl_nfp_disable) to the handle. This is useful when a client wants to disable the proximity functionality but keep the resources allocated to quickly re-enable them when needed.
