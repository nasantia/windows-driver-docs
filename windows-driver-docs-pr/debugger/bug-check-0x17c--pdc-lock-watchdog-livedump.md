 ## PDC\_LOCK\_WATCHDOG\_LIVEDUMP Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|--- |--- |
|1| The thread holding the PDC lock.|
|2| Lock watchdog timeout in milliseconds. |
|3| Reserved. |
|4| Reserved. |


## Cause
-----
A thread has been holding the PDC lock for too long. A livedump is created to provide information to investigate. 

(This code can never be used for a real bugcheck.)

## Resolution
-----

Use the debugger [!thread](-thread.md) command to display the thread holding the lock that is provided in parameter 1.  Analyze that code to determine why it is holding the lock beyond the timeout period.
