# Windows Kernel-Mode Executive Support Library


The Windows operating system uses the term *executive layer* to refer to kernel-mode components that provide a variety of services to device drivers, including:

-   Object management

-   Memory management

-   Process and thread management

-   Input/output management

-   Configuration management

Each of the above managers provides direct interfaces to their individual technologies, as do several libraries. However, routines that are grouped together as a generic interface to the Executive Library are usually prefixed with "**Ex**", for example, **ExGetCurrentResourceThread**. For a list of executive library routines, see [Executive Library Support Routines](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_kernel/#executive-library-support-routines).

Note that the executive layer components are part of Ntoskrnl.exe, but that drivers and the HAL are not part of the executive layer.
