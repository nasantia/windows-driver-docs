# Windows Symbol Packages

Symbol files make it easier to debug your code. The easiest way to get Windows symbols is to use the [Microsoft public symbol server](microsoft-public-symbols.md). The symbol server makes symbols available to your debugging tools as needed. After a symbol file is downloaded from the symbol server it is cached on the local computer for quick access. 


## Symbol package deprecation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are no longer publishing the offline symbol packages for Windows.
>
> With the cadence that we release updates for Windows, the Windows debugging symbols we publish via the packages on this page are quickly made out of  date. 
> We have made significant improvements to the online [Microsoft Symbol Server](microsoft-public-symbols.md) by moving this to be an Azure-based symbol store, and symbols for all Windows versions and updates are available there. 
> You can find more about this in this [blog entry](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windbg/2017/10/18/update-on-microsofts-symbol-server/). 
>
> For information on how to retrieve symbols for a machine that is not connected to the Internet, see [Using a Manifest File with SymChk](using-a-manifest-file-with-symchk.md).
