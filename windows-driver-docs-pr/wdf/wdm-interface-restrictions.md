# WDM Interface Restrictions


\[Applies to KMDF only\]




If your framework-based driver accesses WDM interfaces, you must be aware of the following restrictions:

-   Framework-based drivers must not use the **Tail.Overlay.DriverContext** member of the [**IRP**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_irp) structure, because the framework uses this member.
