## (*New*) WHEA Changes for Windows 8


Starting with Windows 8, the following changes have been made to Windows Hardware Error Architecture (WHEA)

-   A new WMI provider class [**WHEAPolicyManagementMethods**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_whea/).
-   WHEA policies can be managed either though [**WHEAPolicyManagementMethods**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_whea/) or through the WHEA Powershell module. If the policy is updated through either of these modes, the policy values take effect immediately.
