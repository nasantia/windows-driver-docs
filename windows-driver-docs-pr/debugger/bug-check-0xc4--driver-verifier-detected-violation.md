The driver should allocate the Remove Lock inside its device extension, and initialize it a single time. The lock will be deleted together with the device extension.|

Cause
-----

See the description of each code in the Parameters section for a description of the cause. Further information can be obtained by using the [**!analyze -v**](-analyze.md) extension.

Resolution
----------

This bug check can only occur when Driver Verifier has been instructed to monitor one or more drivers. If you did not intend to use Driver Verifier, you should deactivate it. You might also consider removing the driver that caused this problem.

If you are the driver writer, use the information obtained through this bug check to fix the bugs in your code.

For full details on Driver Verifier, see [Driver Verifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/driver-verifier).

Remarks
-------

The \_POOL\_TYPE codes are enumerated in Ntddk.h. In particular, **0** (zero) indicates nonpaged pool and **1** (one) indicates paged pool.

*(Windows 8 and later versions of Windows)* If [DDI compliance checking](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/ddi-compliance-checking) causes a bug check, run [Static Driver Verifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-driver-verifier) on the driver source code and specify the DDI compliance rule (identified by the parameter 1 value) that caused the bug check. Static Driver Verifier can help you locate the cause of the problem in your source code.
