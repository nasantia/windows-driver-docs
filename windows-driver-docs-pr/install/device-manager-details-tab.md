# Device Manager Details tab

Device Manager provides a **Details** tab for each device. This tab displays lots of information useful to driver developers and testers, and aids Microsoft Customer Support Services (CSS) in diagnosing customer problems. The tab's page displays [device identification strings](device-identification-strings.md), together with device and driver configuration information that can be useful when you debug drivers.

## Viewing a device's Details tab

The details tab is enabled by default. To enable this tab, set the user environment variable DEVMGR_SHOW_DETAILS to 1. After you set this environment variable, the **Details** tab of the device will be available in Device Manager. To permanently set a user environment variable, use the **Advanced** tab of the system property sheet.

## Providing firmware revision numbers for the Details tab

Device Manager's **Details** tab can display a device's firmware revision number, if available. A driver can supply a firmware revision number by responding to a WMI request. Specifically, the driver's [**DpWmiQueryDataBlock**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wmilib/nc-wmilib-wmi_query_datablock_callback) routine should support **MSDeviceUI_FirmwareRevision_GUID** by returning a DEVICE_UI_FIRMWARE_REVISION structure (defined in Wmidata.h). The structure must contain the firmware revision number as a NULL-terminated WCHAR string, preceded by a USHORT value that contains the string length (including the **NULL**).
