# Installing Smart Card Reader Drivers


## <span id="_ntovr_installing_smart_card_reader_drivers"></span><span id="_NTOVR_INSTALLING_SMART_CARD_READER_DRIVERS"></span>


This section provides installation information that is specific to smart card reader drivers for Microsoft Windows.

Vendors that supply their own reader drivers should make each driver a member of the **SmartCardReader** setup class in the [**INF Version Section**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/install/inf-version-section) of the driver's INF file. Vendors must also add a section to properly configure the smartcard services. For example:

```cpp
[Version]
Signature="$Windows NT$"
Class=SmartCardReader
ClassGuid={50DD5230-BA8A-11D1-BF5D-0000F805F530}

; ============ Add reg for all readers ===============

[Reader.Install.AddReg]
HKLM, Software\Microsoft\Cryptography\Calais\Readers,,,
HKLM, System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SCardSvr,Start,0x00010001,2
HKLM, System\CurrentControlSet\Services\CertPropSvc,Start,0x00010001,2
```

Vendors that supply their own UMDF reader driver need a registry setting to allow PnP filter drivers to sit on top of the UMDF reflector. Specifically, in the driver INF file, this entry is needed:

```cpp
[Install.NT.Wdf]
UmdfKernelModeClientPolicy=AllowKernelModeClients
```

There are no other special requirements that are associated with installing smart card reader drivers.
