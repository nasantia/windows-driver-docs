# Do you need to write a driver?


Microsoft Windows contains built-in drivers for many device types. If there is a built-in driver for your device type, you won't need to write your own driver. Your device can use the built-in driver.

If your device belongs to a device class that is defined by the USB Device Working Group (DWG), there may already be an existing Windows USB class driver for it. For more information, see [Drivers for the Supported USB Device Classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index).

Currently, Microsoft provides built-in drivers for the following other types of devices:

It is the responsibility of the hardware vendor of an audio device, to provide an adapter driver to work with PortCls. The adapter driver includes initialization code, driver-management code (including the DriverEntry function) and a collection of audio miniport drivers.

<td align="left"><p>Microsoft provides support for SD card readers as follows: The operating system provides support for SD host controllers that connect directly to the PCI bus. When the system enumerates an SD host controller, it loads a native SD bus driver (sdbus.sys). If a user inserts an SD memory card, Windows loads a native SD storage class driver (sffdisk.sys) and storage miniport driver (sffp_sd.sys) on top of the bus driver. If a user inserts an SD card with a different kind of function, such as GPS or wireless LAN, Windows loads a vendor-supplied driver for the device.</p></td>
