# First steps for USB client driver development


This section introduces you to USB driver development. The section applies to you if you are new to driver development; want to implement a driver for a USB device, for which Microsoft does not provide an in-box driver. Such a driver is termed as a *USB client driver* in this documentation set. The topics in this section describe high-level USB concepts and provide step-by-step instructions about performing common tasks of a USB client driver. For detailed information about those concepts, see USB specifications at [USB Documents](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=617552).

As a driver developer, you must have coding experience in the C programming language, and understand the concepts of function pointers, callback functions, and event handlers. If you are going to write a driver based on the User-Mode Driver Framework, make sure that you familiarize yourself with C++ and COM.
