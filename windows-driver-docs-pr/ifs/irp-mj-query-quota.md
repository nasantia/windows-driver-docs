# IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_QUOTA

## When Sent

The IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_QUOTA request is sent by the I/O Manager. This request can be sent, for example, when a user-mode application has called a Microsoft Win32 method such as **IDiskQuotaControl::GetQuotaState**.

## Operation: File System Drivers

If the file system supports disk quotas, the file system driver should extract and decode the file object to determine whether it represents a user open of a file or directory. If it does, the driver should process the query and complete the IRP. Otherwise, the driver should complete the IRP as appropriate without processing the query.

## Operation: File System Filter Drivers

The filter driver should pass this IRP down to the next-lower driver on the stack, unless it needs to explicitly override quota behavior.

## Parameters

A file system or filter driver calls [**IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iogetcurrentirpstacklocation) with the given IRP to get a pointer to its own [**stack location**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_stack_location) in the IRP, shown in the following list as *IrpSp*. (The IRP is shown as *Irp*.) The driver can use the information that is set in the following members of the IRP and the IRP stack location in processing a query quota information request:

### *DeviceObject*  

Pointer to the target device object.

### *DeviceObject->Flags*  

The DO\_BUFFERED\_IO and DO\_DIRECT\_IO flags are used as follows to specify the method by which data is passed to the driver:

|Flag Setting|I/O Method|
|----|----|
|~DO_BUFFERED_IO|~DO_DIRECT_IO|
|METHOD_NEITHER|~DO_BUFFERED_IO|
|DO_DIRECT_IO|METHOD_DIRECT|
|DO_BUFFERED_IO|~DO_DIRECT_IO|
|METHOD_BUFFERED|DO_BUFFERED_IO|
|DO_DIRECT_IO|METHOD_BUFFERED|

### *Irp->AssociatedIrp.SystemBuffer*

Pointer to a system-supplied buffer to be used as an intermediate system buffer, if the DO\_BUFFERED\_IO flag is set in *DeviceObject->Flags*. Otherwise, this member is set to **NULL**.

### *Irp->IoStatus*

Pointer to an [**IO\_STATUS\_BLOCK**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_io_status_block) structure that receives the final completion status and information about the requested operation.

### *Irp->UserBuffer*  

Pointer to a caller-supplied FILE\_QUOTA\_INFORMATION-structured output buffer that receives the quota information for the volume.

### *IrpSp->FileObject*

Pointer to the file object that is associated with *DeviceObject*.

The *IrpSp->FileObject* parameter contains a pointer to the **RelatedFileObject** field, which is also a FILE\_OBJECT structure. The **RelatedFileObject** field of the FILE\_OBJECT structure is not valid during the processing of IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_QUOTA and should not be used.

### *IrpSp->Flags*

This member can be one or more of the following:

|Flag|Meaning|
|----|----|
|SL_INDEX_SPECIFIED|Begin the scan at the entry in the quota list whose index is given by *IrpSp->Parameters.QueryQuota.StartSid*|
|SL_RESTART_SCAN|Begin the scan at the first entry in the list. If this flag is not set, resume the scan from a previous IRP_MJ_QUERY_QUOTA request.|
|SL_RETURN_SINGLE_ENTRY|Return only the first entry that is found.|

### *IrpSp->MajorFunction*

Specifies IRP\_MJ\_QUERY\_QUOTA.

### *IrpSp->Parameters.QueryQuota.Length*

Length, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by *Irp->UserBuffer*.

### *IrpSp->Parameters.QueryQuota.SidList*

Optional pointer to a list of SIDs whose quota information is to be returned. Each entry in the list is a [**FILE\_GET\_QUOTA\_INFORMATION**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntifs/ns-ntifs-_file_get_quota_information) structure. This structure is defined as follows:

```cpp
typedef struct _FILE_GET_QUOTA_INFORMATION {
    ULONG NextEntryOffset;
    ULONG SidLength;
    SID Sid;
} FILE_GET_QUOTA_INFORMATION, *PFILE_GET_QUOTA_INFORMATION;
```

|Member|Meaning|
|-----|----|
|NextEntryOffset|Byte offset of the next FILE_GET_QUOTA_INFORMATION entry, if multiple entries are present in a buffer. This member is zero if no other entries follow this one.|
|SidLength|Length, in bytes, of the **Sid** member.|
|Sid|Security identifier (SID)|

### *IrpSp->Parameters.QueryQuota.SidListLength*

Length, in bytes, of the list of SIDs, if one is specified.

#### *IrpSp->Parameters.QueryQuota.StartSid*

Optional pointer to a SID that indicates that the returned information is to start with an entry other than the first. This parameter is ignored if a SID list is specified.
