# Interpreting HID Reports





This section describes how user-mode applications and kernel-mode drivers use the HidP\_*Xxx*Â [HIDClass support routines](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index) to interpret control data in a HID report.

For information about extracting control data from a report, see the following:
