# IRP\_MN\_QUERY\_PNP\_DEVICE\_STATE


Function, filter, and bus drivers can handle this request.

Major Code
----------

[**IRP\_MJ\_PNP**](irp-mj-pnp.md)
When Sent
---------

The PnP manager sends this IRP after the drivers for a device return success from the [**IRP\_MN\_START\_DEVICE**](irp-mn-start-device.md) request sent when a device is first started. This IRP is not sent on a start after a stop for resource rebalancing. The PnP manager also sends this IRP when a driver for the device calls [**IoInvalidateDeviceState**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioinvalidatedevicestate).

The PnP manager sends this IRP at IRQL PASSIVE\_LEVEL in the context of an arbitrary thread.

## Input Parameters


None

## Output Parameters


Returned in I/O status block.

## I/O Status Block


A driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** to STATUS\_SUCCESS or to an appropriate error status such as STATUS\_UNSUCCESSFUL.

On success, a driver sets **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Information** to a [**PNP\_DEVICE\_STATE**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/handling-an-irp-mn-surprise-removal-request#about-pnpdevicestate) bitmask.


If a function or filter driver does not handle this IRP, it calls [**IoSkipCurrentIrpStackLocation**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/mm-bad-pointer), does not set an [*IoCompletion*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-io_completion_routine) routine, and passes the IRP down to the next driver. Such a driver must not modify **Irp-&gt;IoStatus** and must not complete the IRP.

If a bus driver does not handle this IRP, it leaves **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Status** as is and completes the IRP.

Operation
---------

This IRP is handled first by the driver at the top of the device stack and then by each next lower driver in the stack.

A driver handles this IRP if it has information about the PnP state of a device. A driver can set or clear the flags in the PNP\_DEVICE\_STATE bitmask. If another driver has set a PNP\_DEVICE\_STATE in **Irp-&gt;IoStatus.Information**, a driver must take care to modify the flags in that bitmask rather than overwrite the whole structure.

See [Plug and Play](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/implementing-plug-and-play) for the general rules for handling [Plug and Play minor IRPs](plug-and-play-minor-irps.md).

**Sending This IRP**

Reserved for system use. Drivers must not send this IRP.
