# Battery Miniclass Driver Functionality


## <span id="ddk_battery_miniclass_driver_functionality_dg"></span><span id="DDK_BATTERY_MINICLASS_DRIVER_FUNCTIONALITY_DG"></span>


A battery miniclass driver is responsible for the following:

-   Creating an FDO for its devices and storing device-specific information in the associated device extension

-   Assigning and maintaining the battery tag for the current battery

-   Keeping track of battery capacity, charge, and power state

-   Responding to requests from the class driver for battery status information

-   Notifying the battery class driver when the power state of the battery changes

-   Charging or discharging a specific battery when requested

A battery miniclass driver calls the battery class driver's support routines for other operations, such as handling IOCTLs, as described in [Battery Class Driver Functionality](battery-class-driver-functionality.md).

Every battery miniclass driver provides a set of [BatteryMini*Xxx*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_battery/) routines. The battery class driver calls these routines to request that the miniclass driver perform device-specific tasks. In addition, the miniclass driver must have other routines, as described in [Supplying Required Battery Miniclass Driver Functionality](supplying-required-battery-miniclass-driver-functionality.md).
