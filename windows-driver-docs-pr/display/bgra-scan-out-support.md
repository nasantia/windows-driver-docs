# BGRA Scan-Out Support


This section applies only to Windows 7 and later operating systems.

The scan-out bit is turned on for the DXGI\_FORMAT\_B8G8R8A8\_UNORM and DXGI\_FORMAT\_B8G8R8A8\_UNORM\_SRGB formats. Therefore, the user-mode display driver should be able to perform the following operations:

-   Handle requests for the primary surface that are in these formats.

-   Handle calls to its [**SetDisplayMode**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_setdisplaymode) function for resources that are created with these formats.

-   Handle calls to its [**PresentDXGI**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dxgiddi/ns-dxgiddi-dxgi_ddi_base_functions) function to present these formats through both bit-block transfer (bitblt) and flip operations.

-   Handle calls to its [**BltDXGI**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dxgiddi/ns-dxgiddi-dxgi_ddi_base_functions) function to copy these formats through stretch, rotate, and resolve (in fact, all the bitblt operations that are expected for the RGBA variants).
