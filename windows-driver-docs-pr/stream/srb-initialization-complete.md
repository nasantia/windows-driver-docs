# SRB\_INITIALIZATION\_COMPLETE

The class driver sends this request to signal the minidriver that it has completed its initialization.

### Comments

Once the minidriver completes this request, the class driver can begin to send [**SRB\_OPEN\_STREAM**](srb-open-stream.md) requests.

When this SRB is received by the minidriver, the minidriver should create any necessary Registry entries. For example, a DirectShow filter might register a TV tuner or Crossbar for use with the FilterGraph using the [**StreamClassRegisterFilterWithNoKSPins**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/strmini/nf-strmini-streamclassregisterfilterwithnokspins) routine.
