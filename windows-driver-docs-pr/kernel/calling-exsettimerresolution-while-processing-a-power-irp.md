# Calling ExSetTimerResolution While Processing a Power IRP


During the processing of an [**IRP\_MJ\_POWER**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-power) request, the power manager holds a lock on a resource that [**ExSetTimerResolution**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exsettimerresolution) must acquire to complete. Consequently, a deadlock will occur if a driver directly or indirectly calls this routine while processing a power request, and then waits for the call to the routine to return before the driver completes the power request. While processing a power request, a driver can safely call **ExSetTimerResolution** only if the driver does not wait for the call to this routine to return before completing the power request. For example, a driver can create a worker thread that calls **ExSetTimerResolution**, as long as the driver then completes the power request without waiting for the call to this routine to return.
