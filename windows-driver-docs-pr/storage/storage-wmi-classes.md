# About storage management and WMI classes

This section describes the Storage Management Initiative Specification (SMI-S) requirements and the system-supplied Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes used in the Windows storage architecture. For a discussion of how storage miniport drivers handle WMI classes, see [Handling WMI SRBs in Storage Miniport Drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/handling-wmi-srbs-in-storage-miniport-drivers).

Storage Management Providers, SMI-S requirements, and system-supplied WMI classes are in the following categories:

- [Storage Management Providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/dn342891(v=vs.85))

- [SMI-S Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/smi-s/dn265461(v=vs.85))

- [HBA WMI Classes](hba-wmi-classes.md)

- [iSCSI WMI Classes](iscsi-wmi-classes.md)

- [MPIO WMI Classes](mpio-wmi-classes.md)
