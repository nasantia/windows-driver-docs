# Managing the lifetime of objects in NetAdapterCx

This section describes framework objects and their lifetimes in NetAdapterCx. Use these topics to understand more about networking-specific objects in addition to standard [WDF objects](../wdf/wdf-objects.md), as well as how to initialize, start, stop, and destroy them.

In this section:

- [Summary of NetAdapterCx objects](summary-of-netadaptercx-objects.md)
- [Device and adapter initialization](device-and-adapter-initialization.md)
- [Power-up sequence for a NetAdapterCx client driver](power-up-sequence-for-a-netadaptercx-client-driver.md)
- [Power-down sequence for a NetAdapterCx client driver](power-down-sequence-for-a-netadaptercx-client-driver.md)
