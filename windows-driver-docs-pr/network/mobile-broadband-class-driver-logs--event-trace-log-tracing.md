# Mobile Broadband Class Driver Logs: Event Trace Log Tracing


This topic provides information to help engineers work with the Mobile Broadband Class Driver event trace logs to review and troubleshoot issues.

The information in this topic applies to:

-   Windows 8

## ETL Tracing


The following procedure describes how to review Event Trace Logs (ETL):

1.  Open EventViewer by clicking **Start** &gt; **Run** &gt; **EventVwr**.
2.  In the left pane, navigate to **Applications and Services Logs** &gt; **Microsoft** &gt; **Windows**.

    ![screenshot showing the steps to navigate to the windows folder](images/mbcdlogs1.png)

3.  Navigate further under **Windows** to **wmbclass.**

    ![opening wmbclass folder, showing windows mobile broadband class driver channel](images/mbcdlogs2.png)

4.  Right-click **Windows Mobile Broadband Class Driver Channel** and click **Enable Log**. If you see **Disable Log**, the log is already enabled.

    ![screenshot of context menu showing enable log and refresh options](images/mbcdlogs3.png)

5.  Reproduce the issue and press **Refresh**. After **Refresh**, the logs appear in the central pane.

    ![screenshot of log, where event is selected in upper pane. lower pane shows general tab, with description, and details tab, not selected](images/mbcdlogs4.png)

6.  You can filter the logs using the **Actions Pane** on the right.

    ![using filter current log in the actions pane, example shows current log filtered by event id and event level. in this case event level is error, and event id is -105.](images/mbcdlogs5.png)

    - Output of **ipconfig /all**

**Data path**

If you are troubleshooting issues related to data packet drops, retries, throughput issues, or limited connectivity, please perform the following:

1.  **netsh trace start wwan\_dbg,InternetClient,nid\_wpp provider={c5aa495b-8432-4de5-9d7c-8afc7d3b522a} 0xFFFFFFFF 255**
2.  Start netmon traces on the mobile broadband adapter.

4.  Stop netmon traces and save the netmon capture.
5.  **netsh trace stop**
6.  Upload the following information:

    -   Upload the netmon capture.

**Device enumeration**

If you are troubleshooting issues related to device enumeration at the USB layer, including driver load issues (not driver failing to start), please perform the following:

1.  **logman start USBTrace -p Microsoft-Windows-USB-USBPORT -ets -nb 128 640 -bs 128 -o USBTrace.etl**
2.  **logman update USBTrace -p Microsoft-Windows-USB-USBHUB -ets -nb 128 640 -bs 128**
3.  **logman update trace USBTrace -p {bc6c9364-fc67-42c5-acf7-abed3b12ecc6} 0xFFFFFFFF 255 –ets**
4.  Execute task(s) that leads to unexpected behavior of the system
5.  **Logman stop USBTrace -ets**
6.  Upload the following information:
    -   `USBTrace.etl` created using logman
    -   `c:\windows\inf\setupapi.dev.log`
