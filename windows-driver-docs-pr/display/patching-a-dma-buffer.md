# Patching a DMA Buffer

After the video memory manager is informed where every memory resource for the DMA buffer is located, the GPU scheduler calls the display miniport driver's [**DxgkDdiPatch**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_patch) function to patch the resource with a physical address (that is, assign a physical address to the resource).
