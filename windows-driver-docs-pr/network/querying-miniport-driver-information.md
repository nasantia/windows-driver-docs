# Querying Miniport Driver Information





The **Ndis<em>Xxx</em>** function that a protocol driver calls to query miniport driver information and the *MiniportXxx* function that is used to satisfy such a query depend on whether the miniport driver is connectionless or connection-oriented.

A miniport driver can be queried directly from user mode.
