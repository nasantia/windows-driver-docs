# Windows desktop app for a USB device


In this topic you'll learn about how an application can call [WinUSB Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff540046(v=vs.85)#winusb) to communicate with a USB device. For such an application, [WinUSB](winusb.md) (Winusb.sys) must be installed as the device's function driver. WinUSB in the device's kernel-mode stack. This driver is included in Windows in the \\Windows\\System32\\drivers folder.

If you are using Winusb.sys as a USB device's function driver, you can call [WinUSB Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/drivers/ff540046(v=vs.85)#winusb) from an application to communicate with the device. These functions, exposed by the user-mode DLL Winusb.dll, simplify the communication process. Instead of constructing device I/O control requests to perform standard USB operations (such as configuring the device, sending control requests, and transferring data to or from the device), applications call the equivalent WinUSB function.

Winusb.dll uses the application-supplied data to construct the appropriate device I/O control request, and then sends the request to Winusb.sys for processing. To communicate with the USB stack, the WinUSB function calls the [**DeviceIoControl**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol) function with the appropriate IOCTL that correlates to the application's request. When the request is complete, the WinUSB function passes any information returned by Winusb.sys (such as data from a read request) back to the calling process. If the call to **DeviceIoControl** is successful, it returns a nonzero value. If the call fails or is pending (not processed immediately), **DeviceIoControl** returns a zero value. In case of an error, the application can call [**GetLastError**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror) for a more detailed error message.

It is simpler to use WinUSB functions to communicate with a device than it is to implement a driver. However, note the following limitations:

-   WinUSB functions allow one application at a time to communicate with the device. If you require more than one application to communicate concurrently with a device, you must implement a function driver.
-   Before Windows 8.1, WinUSB functions do not support streaming data to or from isochronous endpoints.
-   WinUSB functions do not support devices that already have kernel-mode support. Examples of such devices include modems and network adapters, which are supported by the telephony API (TAPI) and NDIS, respectively.
-   For multifunction devices, you can use the device's INF file to specify either an in-box kernel-mode driver or Winusb.sys for each USB function separately. However, you can specify only one of these options for a particular function, not both.

**Note**  WinUSB functions require Windows XP or later. You can use these functions in your C/C++ application to communicate with your USB device. To write a UWP app that uses WinUSB APIs, see [UWP app for a USB device](writing-usb-device-companion-apps-for-microsoft-store.md).
