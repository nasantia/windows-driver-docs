# Tools samples

The driver samples in this directory contains intentional code errors that are designed to show the capabilities and features of Static Driver Verifier (SDV).

SDV is a static verification tool that systematically analyzes the source code of Windows kernel-mode drivers. SDV is included in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) and can be run from Microsoft Visual Studio.
