# Access to Scatter/Gather Lists in the ATA Port I/O Model

**NOTE** The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the [Storport driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver) and [Storport miniport](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers) driver models.



The [ATA Port I/O Model](ata-port-i-o-model.md), such as the [Storport I/O Model](storport-i-o-model.md), provides its miniport drivers that have direct access to the system's scatter/gather list structure. This direct access reduces the number of calls that the miniport driver must make to port driver support routines to build its private scatter/gather list.

On the other hand, the SCSI port I/O model forces a miniport driver to manually discover and build its own scatter/gather list through repeated calls to the [**ScsiPortGetPhysicalAddress**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/srb/nf-srb-scsiportgetphysicaladdress) routine.

ATA port miniport drivers can directly access the system's scatter/gather list by using the [**AtaPortGetScatterGatherList**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/irb/nf-irb-ataportgetscattergatherlist) routine. The scatter/gather list that **AtaPortGetScatterGatherList** returns is valid only until the IRB is completed.

The miniport driver does not have to free the memory for the scatter/gather list that **AtaPortGetScatterGatherList** returns.

The miniport driver's [**IdeHwBuildIo**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/irb/nc-irb-ide_hw_buildio) routine should translate the scatter/gather list, if it is necessary.
