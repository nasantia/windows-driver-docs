# ATA Port Driver's Power Management

**NOTE** The ATA port driver and ATA miniport driver models may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, we recommend using the [Storport driver](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-driver) and [Storport miniport](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/storport-miniport-drivers) driver models.


The ATA port driver enables the miniport driver to change the power state on an individual LUN or an individual channel. To change the power state of a LUN, the ATA port driver sends an IRB with a function value of IRB\_FUNCTION\_POWER\_CHANGE to the device driver. The **PowerChange** member of the IRB indicates the current and target power states. To change the power state of the whole channel, the port driver calls the [**IdeHwControl**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/irb/nc-irb-ide_hw_control) miniport driver routine.

The miniport driver can begin a power state transition by calling [**AtaPortRequestPowerStateChange**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/irb/nf-irb-ataportrequestpowerstatechange). A miniport driver might call this routine after, for example, a hot plug of an IDE device.

Doing idle detection from a miniport driver is strongly discouraged.
