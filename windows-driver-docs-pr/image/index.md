# Imaging device driver design guide


This section contains information about Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) drivers, Still Image (STI) drivers, and Web Services on Devices (WSD.)

> [!NOTE]
> The WIA programming interface is used to develop imaging drivers for modern Windows operating systems. 
> The STI programming interface was used to develop imaging drivers in legacy Windows operating systems. 
> The STI programming interface documentation will be archived in a future release.
