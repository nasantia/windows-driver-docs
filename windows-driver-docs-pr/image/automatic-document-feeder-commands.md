# Automatic Document Feeder Commands


## <span id="ddk_automatic_document_feeder_commands_si"></span><span id="DDK_AUTOMATIC_DOCUMENT_FEEDER_COMMANDS_SI"></span>


The commands in this section are for microdrivers that support an automatic document feeder (ADF). To report that your microdriver supports an automatic document feeder, set the **ADF** member in the [**SCANINFO**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wiamicro/ns-wiamicro-_scaninfo) structure to 1 (or 2 if the ADF has a duplexer) during the CMD\_INITIALIZE command. This will cause the WIA Flatbed driver to add the needed properties for ADF control and use the commands in this section.

<span id="CMD_LOAD_ADF"></span><span id="cmd_load_adf"></span>CMD\_LOAD\_ADF  
Called by the WIA Flatbed driver to load a page into the ADF. If this command does not apply to the device, return E\_NOTIMPL. This command is optional for a device that automatically feeds a page.

<span id="CMD_UNLOAD_ADF"></span><span id="cmd_unload_adf"></span>CMD\_UNLOAD\_ADF  
Called by the WIA Flatbed driver to unload a page from the ADF. If this command does not apply to the device, return E\_NOTIMPL. This command is optional for a device that automatically unfeeds a page.

<span id="CMD_GETADFAVAILABLE"></span><span id="cmd_getadfavailable"></span>CMD\_GETADFAVAILABLE  
Called by the WIA Flatbed driver to determine whether an ADF is available for use. If an ADF is available, return S\_OK. If this command does not apply to the device, return E\_NOTIMPL.

<span id="CMD_GETADFHASPAPER"></span><span id="cmd_getadfhaspaper"></span>CMD\_GETADFHASPAPER  
Called by the WIA Flatbed driver to get the paper status of the device's ADF. Set the **lVal** member of the passed [**VAL**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wiamicro/ns-wiamicro-val) structure to the appropriate status value. (See CMD\_ADFGETSTATUS for possible status values.)

<span id="CMD_GETADFOPEN"></span><span id="cmd_getadfopen"></span>CMD\_GETADFOPEN  
Same as CMD\_GETADFREADY. This command is not currently used by the WIA Flatbed Driver.

<span id="CMD_GETADFSTATUS"></span><span id="cmd_getadfstatus"></span>CMD\_GETADFSTATUS  
Called by the WIA Flatbed driver to get the status of the ADF attached to the device. Set the **lVal** member of the passed [**VAL**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wiamicro/ns-wiamicro-val) structure to the appropriate status value. Possible status values are as follows.

<td><p>The ADF has a paper jam.</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>MCRO_ERROR_PAPER_PROBLEM</p></td>
<td><p>The ADF has a paper problem.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>MCRO_ERROR_USER_INTERVENTION</p></td>
<td><p>The user needs to interact with the device.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>MCRO_STATUS_OK</p></td>
<td><p>There is no error to report.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

<span id="CMD_GETADFUNLOADREADY"></span><span id="cmd_getadfunloadready"></span>CMD\_GETADFUNLOADREADY  
Called by the WIA Flatbed Driver to determine whether the ADF is ready for a page to be unloaded. If so, return S\_OK. If this command does not apply to the device, return E\_NOTIMPL.
