# Breaking Into the Debugger


## <span id="ddk_breaking_into_the_debugger_tools"></span><span id="DDK_BREAKING_INTO_THE_DEBUGGER_TOOLS"></span>


User-mode and kernel-mode drivers use different routines to break into the debugger.

### <span id="user_mode_break_routines"></span><span id="USER_MODE_BREAK_ROUTINES"></span>User-Mode Break Routines

A break routine causes an exception to occur in the current process, so that the calling thread can signal the debugger associated with the calling process.

To break into a debugger from a user-mode program, use the **DebugBreak** routine. Its prototype is as follows:

```
VOID DebugBreak(VOID);
```

This routine can be called by any user-mode driver that includes the windows.h header. For complete documentation of this routine and other user-mode routines useful for debugging, see the Microsoft Windows SDK.

When a user-mode program calls **DebugBreak**, the following possible actions will occur:

1.  If a user-mode debugger is attached, the program will break into the debugger. This means that the program will pause and the debugger will become active.

2.  If a user-mode debugger is not attached, but kernel-mode debugging was enabled at boot time, the entire computer will break into the kernel debugger. If a kernel debugger is not attached, the computer will freeze and await a kernel debugger.

3.  If a user-mode debugger is not attached, and kernel-mode debugging is not enabled, the program will terminate with an unhandled exception, and the post-mortem (just-in-time) debugger will be activated. By default, the postmortem debugger is Dr. Watson, which will create a crash dump file and then ask you if you want to send this crash dump file to Microsoft.

### <span id="kernel_mode_break_routines"></span><span id="KERNEL_MODE_BREAK_ROUTINES"></span>Kernel-Mode Break Routines

When a kernel-mode program breaks into the debugger, the entire operating system freezes until the kernel debugger allows execution to resume. If a kernel debugger is not present, this is treated as a bug check.

The [**DbgBreakPoint**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-dbgbreakpoint) routine works in kernel-mode code, but is otherwise similar to the **DebugBreak** user-mode routine.

The [**DbgBreakPointWithStatus**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-dbgbreakpointwithstatus) routine also causes a break, but it additionally sends a 32-bit status code to the debugger.

The [**KdBreakPoint**](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/previsioning-framework/ff548063(v=vs.85)) and [**KdBreakPointWithStatus**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-kdbreakpointwithstatus) routines are identical to **DbgBreakPoint** and **DbgBreakPointWithStatus**, respectively, when compiled in the checked build environment. When compiled in the free build environment, they have no effect.

### <span id="kernel_mode_conditional_break_macros"></span><span id="KERNEL_MODE_CONDITIONAL_BREAK_MACROS"></span>Kernel-Mode Conditional Break Macros

Two conditional break macros are available for kernel-mode drivers:

-   The [**ASSERT**](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/hardware/previsioning-framework/ff542107(v=vs.85)) macro tests a logical expression. If the expression is false, execution halts and the debugger becomes active. The failed expression and its location in the program are displayed in the debugger.

-   The [**ASSERTMSG**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-assertmsg) macro is identical to **ASSERT** except that it allows an additional message to be sent to the debugger.

**ASSERT** and **ASSERTMSG** are only active when compiled in the checked build environment. When compiled in the free build environment, they have no effect.
