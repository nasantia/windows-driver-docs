# Reusing IRPs





Under certain circumstances, drivers can *reuse* IRPs. The driver can allocate a pool of memory buffers that it uses to hold IRPs as they need to be created.

Drivers must not attempt to reuse IRPs issued by the I/O manager. In particular, drivers should not attempt to reuse IRPs created by the [**IoMakeAssociatedIrp**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-iomakeassociatedirp), [**IoBuildSynchronousFsdRequest**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iobuildsynchronousfsdrequest), [**IoBuildAsynchronousFsdRequest**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iobuildasynchronousfsdrequest), or [**IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iobuilddeviceiocontrolrequest) routines.

Drivers can safely reuse IRPs that they have created, as follows:

1.  If a driver allocates an IRP as raw memory (for example, by calling [**ExAllocatePoolWithTag**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-exallocatepoolwithtag)), and then initializes it with [**IoInitializeIrp**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioinitializeirp), then it can safely call **IoInitializeIrp** or [**IoReuseIrp**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioreuseirp) to reinitialize the memory buffer.

2.  On Microsoft Windows 2000 and later operating systems, drivers that create an IRP with [**IoAllocateIrp**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioallocateirp) can reuse the IRP by calling **IoReuseIrp**.

3.  If a driver allocates an IRP by calling **IoAllocateIrp** with the *ChargeQuota* parameter set to **FALSE**, then it can safely use **IoInitializeIrp** to reinitialize the IRP. Drivers that must work on Windows 98/Me can use this method as a work-around. Drivers designed strictly for Windows 2000 and later operating systems should use the previous method.
