title: KSPROPERTY\_BDA\_LNB\_SWITCH\_FREQUENCY
description: Clients use KSPROPERTY\_BDA\_LNB\_SWITCH\_FREQUENCY to inform the RF tuner node about the frequency of incoming RF signals at which the tuner should inform the low-noise block (LNB) device to switch from using low-band local oscillator frequency (LOF) to using high-band LOF or vice versa when the LNB shifts the frequency of RF signals.

# KSPROPERTY\_BDA\_LNB\_SWITCH\_FREQUENCY


Clients use KSPROPERTY\_BDA\_LNB\_SWITCH\_FREQUENCY to inform the RF tuner node about the frequency of incoming RF signals at which the tuner should inform the low-noise block (LNB) device to switch from using low-band local oscillator frequency (LOF) to using high-band LOF or vice versa when the LNB shifts the frequency of RF signals.

Remarks
-------

The **NodeId** member of KSP\_NODE specifies the identifier of the RF tuner node.

The property value specifies the frequency of incoming RF signals at which the LNB should switch from using low-band LOF to using high-band LOF.

If a client sends a KSPROPERTY\_BDA\_RF\_TUNER\_FREQUENCY request to tune an RF tuner to a specific frequency and this frequency is greater than or equal to the switch frequency specified using KSPROPERTY\_BDA\_LNB\_SWITCH\_FREQUENCY, then the RF tuner should send a command to the LNB to switch to the high-band LOF. The RF tuner should then expect that the LNB device shifts the frequency of the incoming RF signal by the high-band LOF amount, which was specified using KSPROPERTY\_BDA\_LNB\_LOF\_HIGH\_BAND.

Likewise, if a client sends a KSPROPERTY\_BDA\_RF\_TUNER\_FREQUENCY request to tune an RF tuner to a specific frequency and this frequency is less than the switch frequency, then the RF tuner should send a command to the LNB to switch to the low-band LOF. The RF tuner should then expect that the LNB device shifts the frequency of the incoming RF signal by the low-band LOF amount, which was specified using KSPROPERTY\_BDA\_LNB\_LOF\_LOW\_BAND.
