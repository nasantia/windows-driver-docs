# Obtaining Additional Registry Information


Registry filtering drivers that run on Windows Vista and later operating system versions can obtain the following additional information about registry operations:

-   Object identifiers and names

    The [**CmCallbackGetKeyObjectIDEx**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-cmcallbackgetkeyobjectidex) routine retrieves the registry key identifier and object name that are associated with a specified registry key object.

-   Transaction objects

    The [**CmGetBoundTransaction**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-cmgetboundtransaction) routine returns a pointer to the transaction object that represents the [transaction](using-kernel-transaction-manager.md), if any, that is associated with a registry key object.

-   Version information

    The [**CmGetCallbackVersion**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-cmgetcallbackversion) routine retrieves the major and minor version numbers for the current version of the configuration manager's registry callback feature.
