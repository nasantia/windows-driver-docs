# AddDevice Routine of a Battery Miniclass Driver


## <span id="ddk_adddevice_routine_of_battery_miniclass_driver_dg"></span><span id="DDK_ADDDEVICE_ROUTINE_OF_BATTERY_MINICLASS_DRIVER_DG"></span>


Every battery miniclass driver must have an [*AddDevice*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_add_device) routine, which initializes battery-specific state. The PnP Manager calls the *AddDevice* routine for each battery device controlled by this miniclass driver.

In addition to the tasks required of a PnP *AddDevice* routine, the *AddDevice* routine for a battery miniclass driver must also do the following:

1.  Create an FDO for the battery and attach the FDO to the device stack for the controller.

2.  Initialize the [**BATTERY\_MINIPORT\_INFO**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/batclass/ns-batclass-battery_miniport_info) structure and call [**BatteryClassInitializeDevice**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/batclass/nf-batclass-batteryclassinitializedevice) to register the miniclass driver with the battery class driver.

3.  Perform any other initialization required for the device.
