# Return Codes for Direct3D Driver Callbacks


## <span id="ddk_return_codes_for_direct3d_driver_callbacks_gg"></span><span id="DDK_RETURN_CODES_FOR_DIRECT3D_DRIVER_CALLBACKS_GG"></span>


The following table lists values that can be returned by the [Direct3D Driver-Supplied Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/index). The DDHAL\_DRIVER\_*Xxx* values actually are returned in the DWORD return value. The D3D\_OK value, D3DHAL\_*Xxx* values, and D3DERR\_*Xxx* error codes are returned in the **ddrval** member of the structure to which the particular function's parameter points.

For specific error codes that each function can return, see the function and structure descriptions in the reference section. Refer to Direct3D header files *d3d.h* and *d3dhal.h* for a complete listing of error codes and return values (also, *d3d8.h* and *d3d9.h* for DirectX versions 8.0 and 9.0). Note that error codes are represented by negative values and cannot be combined.

A function in a Direct3D driver must return one of the two return codes: DDHAL\_DRIVER\_HANDLED or DDHAL\_DRIVER\_NOTHANDLED. If the driver returns DDHAL\_DRIVER\_HANDLED, then it must also return either D3D\_OK or one of the values listed in *d3d.h* or *d3dhal.h*. A function in a Direct3D driver can return the values in the following table. These values are defined in *d3d.h* and *d3dhal.h*.

Otherwise, Direct3D handles the operation as if the driver callback had not been defined by executing the Direct3D device-independent implementation. Direct3D typically ignores any value returned in the <strong>ddrval</strong> member of that callback's parameter structure.</p></td>
