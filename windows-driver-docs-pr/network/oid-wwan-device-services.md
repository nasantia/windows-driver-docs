# OID\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICES


OID\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICES returns the list of device services supported by the miniport driver.

Miniport drivers must process query requests asynchronously, initially returning NDIS\_STATUS\_INDICATION\_REQUIRED to the original request, and later sending a NDIS\_STATUS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICES status notification containing a [**NDIS\_WWAN\_DEVICE\_SERVICES**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_netvista/) structure that indicates the supported device service GUIDs.

Set requests are not supported.
