# Supporting 2D DirectSound Acceleration in WDM Audio


## <span id="supporting_2d_directsound_acceleration_in_wdm_audio"></span><span id="SUPPORTING_2D_DIRECTSOUND_ACCELERATION_IN_WDM_AUDIO"></span>


DirectSound exposes hardware-accelerated 2D mixing for WDM audio miniport drivers that meet the following requirements:

-   The miniport driver includes a pin factory that is an IRP sink (KSPIN\_COMMUNICATION\_SINK), has a [**KSPIN\_DATAFLOW**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ks/ne-ks-kspin_dataflow) direction of KSPIN\_DATAFLOW\_IN, and exposes a data range ([**KSDATARANGE\_AUDIO**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ksmedia/ns-ksmedia-ksdatarange_audio) structure) in which the specifier (**DataFormat**.**Specifier** member) is set to KSDATAFORMAT\_SPECIFIER\_DSOUND.

-   The pin factory's [**KSPROPERTY\_PIN\_CINSTANCES**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/stream/ksproperty-pin-cinstances) handler sets the **PossibleCount** member of the **KSPIN\_CINSTANCES** structure to a value of two or greater (the first pin is always reserved for KMixer). The **PossibleCount** value specifies the number of pin instances that can currently be instantiated from the pin factory.

-   The pin factory must support the [**KSPROPERTY\_AUDIO\_CPU\_RESOURCES**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/audio/ksproperty-audio-cpu-resources) property and should report KSAUDIO\_CPU\_RESOURCES\_NOT\_HOST\_CPU for all nodes that are hardware accelerated.

-   The pin should meet the [DirectSound node-ordering requirements](directsound-node-ordering-requirements.md).
