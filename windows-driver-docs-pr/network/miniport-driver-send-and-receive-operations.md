# Miniport Driver Send and Receive Operations





Miniport drivers handle send requests from overlying drivers and originate receive indications. In a single function call, NDIS miniport drivers can indicate a linked list with multiple received [**NET\_BUFFER\_LIST**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_net_buffer_list) structures. Miniport drivers can handle send requests for lists of multiple NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structures with multiple [**NET\_BUFFER**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/ns-ndis-_net_buffer) structures on each NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure.

Miniport drivers must manage receive buffer pools. Most miniport drivers create pools that preallocate a single NET\_BUFFER structure with each NET\_BUFFER\_LIST structure.

The following topics provide more information about miniport driver buffer management, send operations, and receive operations:
