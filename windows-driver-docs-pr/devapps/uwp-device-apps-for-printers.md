# UWP device apps for printers


This section introduces UWP device apps for printers. UWP device apps can highlight the special features of printers through customized print settings flyouts and notifications support. UWP device apps can also display printer status, manage print jobs, and perform printer maintenance tasks. To learn more about UWP device apps in general, see [Meet UWP device apps](meet-uwp-device-apps.md).

**Important**  To use UWP device app features, your printer must support the v4 print driver model. For more info, see [Developing v4 print drivers](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=314231).

Use a UWP device app for a printer if you'd like to:

-   Highlight advanced device capabilities, such as printing multiple photos per page.
-   Make device-specific recommendations. For example, you could use your device app to present image management options or provide methods for setting and saving printer-specific defaults.

## <span id="General_recommendations"></span><span id="general_recommendations"></span><span id="GENERAL_RECOMMENDATIONS"></span>General recommendations


-   After you call window.print(), check for and handle error messages from within the onClick event handler for your app's Print button. This allows your app to abort a print request if, for example, no printer is available.
-   Notify the user if printing fails and, if possible, explain the reason for the failure.
-   If you plan to customize the print experience, separate this code into a print companion app. This allows you to componentize your code and eases the test and debugging process.
-   Don't try to customize your print experience to use the V3 print driver.
-   Don't advertise accessories for the print device in your customized print UI.
-   Don't show items for sale that aren't related to the reason the Microsoft Store device app was invoked. For example, it's relevant to show print cartridges for purchase after a user clicks a notification alerting them that ink is low. However, it's not appropriate to also try to sell print cords or photo printing kits in this same scenario.
-   Don't redirect the user to your company’s website for more product sales.
-   Don't present information that isn't relevant to the task of setting printing preferences. For example, don't provide info about how to clean the print heads or how to align and test the print nozzles.

The UWP device app samples for printers demonstrate the printer-related features that you can implement in your own UWP device app. Each sample also includes the `PrinterExtensionLibrary` project, that you can reuse in your own app to help with printer extensions. The printer extension library wraps the COM implementation of the [printer extension interfaces](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=299887) from the v4 print driver.


**Windows 8 Samples:**

-   The [Print job management and printer maintenance](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=299829) sample demonstrates how to manage print jobs and perform printer maintenance tasks using bidirectional communications (Bidi).

-   The [Print settings and print notifications](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=242862) sample shows how to create a UWP device app that provides a customized flyout for advanced print settings, can display printer status, and can display printer notifications in tiles or toasts.


**Windows 10 Sample:**

-   The [Writing print workflow apps and migrating WSDAs to UWP](https://github.com/microsoft/print-oem-samples) sample shows OEM print partners how to use the Print Workflow feature and migrate their existing Windows Store Device Apps (WSDAs) code to the Universal Windows Platform.
