# Load Order Groups and Altitudes for Minifilter Drivers


Windows uses a dedicated set of load order groups for file system filter drivers and minifilter drivers that are loaded at system startup.

Legacy file system filter drivers can attach only to the top of an existing file system driver stack and cannot attach in the middle of a stack. As a result, the start type for a driver and load order group are important to legacy file system filter drivers, because the earlier a filter driver loads, the lower it can attach on the file system driver stack.

Drivers are loaded first based on the start type for the driver, which represents phases of booting a system. For more information about start types, see "Driver Start Types" in [What Determines When a Driver Is Loaded](what-determines-when-a-driver-is-loaded.md). All file system filter drivers and minifilter drivers that specify a start type of SERVICE\_BOOT\_START will be loaded before drivers with a start type of SERVICE\_SYSTEM\_START or SERVICE\_AUTO\_START. The start type is specified by the **StartType** entry in the ServiceInstall Section of an INF file that is used to install the minifilter driver. Within each start type category, the load order group determines when file system filter drivers and minifilter drivers will be loaded.

A minifilter driver can be loaded at any time. The concept of load order groups is still required by minifilter drivers for interoperability with legacy file system filter drivers. Every minifilter driver must have a unique identifier called *altitude*. The altitude of a minifilter driver defines its position relative to other minifilter drivers in the I/O stack when the minifilter driver is loaded. The altitude is an infinite-precision string interpreted as a decimal number. A minifilter driver that has a low numerical altitude is loaded into the I/O stack below a minifilter driver that has a higher numerical value.

Each load order group has a defined range of altitudes. The allocation of altitudes to minifilter drivers is managed by Microsoft. To request an altitude for your minifilter driver, send an email message to <fsfcomm@microsoft.com> asking for one to be assigned.

A minifilter driver must specify an altitude value from an altitude range that represents a load order group. Altitude values for a minifilter driver are specified in the Instance definitions of the Strings Section in the INF file that is used to install the minifilter driver. Instance definitions can also be specified in calls to the [**InstanceSetupCallback**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/nc-fltkernel-pflt_instance_setup_callback) routine in the [**FLT\_REGISTRATION**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fltkernel/ns-fltkernel-_flt_registration) structure. Multiple instances and altitudes can be defined for a minifilter driver. These instance definitions apply across all volumes.

The following rules about start type and load order groups determine when a minifilter driver will be loaded:

-   A minifilter driver that specifies a particular start type and load order group is loaded at the same time as other file system filter drivers and minifilter drivers in that start type and load order group.

-   Within each load order group, file system filter drivers and minifilter drivers are generally loaded in random order. This normally results in drivers being loaded based on the order in which the driver was installed.

-   If a file system filter driver or minifilter driver does not specify a load order group, it is loaded after all the other drivers of the same start type that do specify a load order group.

The following table lists the system-defined load order groups and altitude ranges for minifilter drivers. For each load order group, the Load order group column contains the value that should be specified for that group in the **LoadOrderGroup** entry in the ServiceInstall Section of a minifilter's INF file. The Altitude range column contains the range of altitudes for a particular load order group. A minifilter driver must request an altitude allocation from Microsoft in the appropriate load order group or groups.

Note that the load order groups and altitude ranges are listed as they appear on the stack, which is the reverse of the order in which they are loaded.
