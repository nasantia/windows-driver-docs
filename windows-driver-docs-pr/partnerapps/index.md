# Partner app development

Partners have the ability to create special use applications for things like the Windows 10 settings app. Some partner-specific app development scenarios require functionalityâ€”such as access to system APIs--that is not available to APIs with General capabilities. Instead these apps require Restricted or special use capabilities, allowing for functionality available for partner development in a controlled fashion.
