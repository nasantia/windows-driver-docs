# Installing a Network Print Provider





To install a new network print provider, you must supply an installer that copies the provider DLL into the target system's \\System32 subdirectory and then calls **AddPrintProvidor** (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation). This function creates a registry entry for the provider and adds the provider to the end of the spooler's list of installed providers. The function then loads the provider DLL and calls the provider's [**InitializePrintProvidor**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/winsplp/nf-winsplp-initializeprintprovidor) function.

To create a connection to a printer supported by a network print provider, a user invokes the Add Printer Wizard and chooses the "Network printer server" option. The user specifies a print queue using the \\\\*Server*\\*Printer* format, and the provider's **OpenPrinter** function must recognize that print queue name.
