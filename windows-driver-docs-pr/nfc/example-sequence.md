# Example sequence


The following is an example sequence of IOCTLs in the Smart Card resource manager:

## Start-up sequence


1.  Use the DevObj or CfgMgr API with the Smart Card access device interface GUID to discover the NFC device driver’s name, and use it with CreateFile to open a device handle.

2.  Initialize thread pool.

3.  Determine reader name.

    -   IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_GET\_ATTRIBUTE on SCARD\_ATTR\_VENDOR\_NAME, SCARD\_ATTR\_VENDOR\_IFD\_TYPE, and SCARD\_ATTR\_DEVICE\_UNIT

4.  Determine reader characteristics.
    -   IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_GET\_ATTRIBUTE on SCARD\_ATTR\_CHARACTERISTICS

5.  Start the card state monitor.
    -   IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_IS\_PRESENT – To wait for a smart card arrival.

    -   IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_IS\_ABSENT – To wait for the smart card departure.

The Power reset is irrelevant since we do not support SCARD\_SWALLOWED, SCARD\_POWERED state.

## Connect sequence


1.  Start of loop.

2.  IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_GET\_STATE

    -   Case SCARD\_UNKNOWN and SCARD\_ABSENT, do nothing

    -   Case SCARD\_PRESENT, swallow card

    -   Case SCARD\_SWALLOWED, cold reset

    -   Case SCARD\_POWERED, warm reset

    -   Case SCARD\_NEGOTIABLE, determine the card ATR

    -   Case SCARD\_SPECIFIC, determine the card ATR and protocol

3.  IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_SET\_PROTOCOL

## Disconnect sequence


1.  Power-down timeout starts.

2.  Start of loop.

3.  IOCTL\_SMARTCARD\_GET\_STATE

    -   Case SCARD\_SPECIFIC, SCARD\_NEGOTIABLE, SCARD\_POWERED, set power down

    -   Case SCARD\_SWALLOWED, SCARD\_PRESENT, do nothing

    -   Case SCARD\_ABSENT, SCARD\_UNKNOWN, do nothing
