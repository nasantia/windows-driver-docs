# DevCon Dp\_delete

Deletes a third-party (OEM) driver package from the driver store on the local computer. This command deletes the INF file, the PNF file, and the associated catalog file (.cat).

```command
    devcon [-f] dp_delete inf
```

## Parameters

**-f**
This parameter deletes the driver package even if a device is using it at the time.

*inf*
The OEM\*.inf file name of the INF file. Windows assigns a file name with this format to the INF file when you add the driver package to the driver store, such as by using [**DevCon dp\_add**](devcon-dp-add.md).
