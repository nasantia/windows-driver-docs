# Building a Basic v4 Printer Driver

Build a basic v4 printer driver by using the driver development wizard in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 to select the minimum set of features to create a functional printer driver.

The instructions in this topic will focus on the steps required for building a driver, and will not explain the many printer driver options available in the wizard. The intent of this topic is to provide an introduction to the process involved when developing a printer driver in Visual Studio 2017. A more detailed look at the printer driver options is provided in [Exploring the Driver Options in the Wizard](exploring-the-driver-options-in-the-wizard.md).

## Instructions

### Select features for the basic driver

1. In Visual Studio, in the main menu, click **File** &gt; **New** &gt; **Project**.

2. In the **New Project** window, in the top-right search box, type *printer driver v4* and press enter. This will retrieve all driver templates whose names contain the search text.

3. In the middle pane, select **Printer Driver V4**.

4. Type a name for your driver in the **Name** field, and then click **OK**. For example, you could type *MyV4PrintDriver*.

5. In the **Create a v4 Print Driver Wizard**, under **Choose the driver rendering type:**, click **V4 print driver with custom rendering filters (accepts XPS only)**.

6. Leave all other options at their default settings and click **Next**.

7. In the **Setup information** section of the wizard, leave all options at their default settings, then click **Next**.

8. In the **Setup information (page 2)** section of the wizard, leave all options at their default settings, then click **Next**.

Microsoft Visual Studio uses the preceding selections to generate the project files for *MyV4PrintDriver*.

### Verify the generated driver files

1. Navigate to the folder for the generated driver files. For example, if you named your project *MyV4PrintDriver*, then by default, the files would be saved to the following location: *My Documents &gt; Visual Studio 2017 &gt; Projects &gt; MyV4PrintDriver &gt; MyV4PrintDriver*.

2. Verify that the folder contains the following files:

    | File name                                              | File type                                                  |
    |--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | MyV4PrintDriver.gpd                                    | Printer description file                                   |
    | MyV4PrintDriver.inf                                    | Setup information file                                     |
    | MyV4PrintDriver.vcxproj                                | C++ Project file                                           |
    | MyV4PrintDriver.vcxproj.filters                        | C++ Project filters file                                   |
    | MyV4PrintDriver-manifest.ini                           | Configuration settings file (a.k.a. print driver manifest) |
    | V4PrintDriver-Intellisense.js                          | JavaScript file for Intellisense                           |
    | V4PrintDriver-Intellisense-Windows8.1.js               | JavaScript file for Intellisense                           |

Notice from the preceding table that one of the files that is created is an INF file. Note that Visual Studio created a skeletal INF file that has to be completed so that it can be used to install the driver.

### Create a unique **PrinterDriverID** for the driver

1. In the Visual Studio Tools menu select **Create GUID**.

2. Select option **4. Registry Format** and click the **Copy** button.

3. In Visual Studio, in the Solution Explorer, expand the *MyV4PrintDriver* node.

4. Click **Driver Files**, then in the **Properties** window, look at the value for the *Unique Identifier* field. Replace this value with the GUID you generated using **Paste**.

### Complete the INF file

In the MyV4PrintDriver project there should be an entry for **Driver Files**. Open this and the file MyV4PrintDriver.inf should be listed. Open this file.

#### 1. Update the Copyright notice

The first 2 lines of the INF file are the copyright notice for the driver package.

Line 1 contains the year and name of your company. Replace the characters YYYY with the current year and replace the characters &lt;*Your manufacturer name*&gt; with the name of your company.

Line 2 describes the contents of the driver INF including Manufacturer name and device Model information. Replace the characters &lt;*Your manufacturer name*&gt; with the name of your company and replace the characters of &lt;*Printer Model*&gt; with the model name of the printer supported by the driver.

For example, if the year is 2017 and your company’s name is Fabrikam, and the print device model is 1234 you would type the following:

```inf
; Copyright (c) 2017 Fabrikam
; INF file for the Fabrikam 1234 print driver
```

#### 2. Verify the **\[Version\]** section is correct

Find the line containing **\[Version\]**.

- Check and make sure that you see this line:

    ```inf
    **ClassVer**=4.0
    ```

- Check and make sure that you see this line:

    ```inf
    **Signature**="$WINDOWS NT$"
    ```

#### 3. Configure the **\[SourceDisksFiles\]** section

Find the line containing **\[SourceDisksFiles\]**.

Below this type the following lines:

```inf
MyV4PrintDriver.gpd=1
MyV4PrintDriver-manifest.ini=1
MyV4PrintDriverRenderFilter-PipelineConfig.xml=1
MyV4PrintDriverRenderFilter.dll=1
```

#### 4. Configure the **\[DriverFiles\]** section

Find the line containing **\[DriverFiles\]**.

Below this type the following lines:

```inf
MyV4PrintDriver.gpd
MyV4PrintDriver-manifest.ini
MyV4PrintDriverRenderFilter-PipelineConfig.xml
MyV4PrintDriverRenderFilter.dll
```

#### 5. Configure the **\[Standard.NT$ARCH$\]** section

Find the line containing **\[Standard.NT$ARCH$\]**.

This section references the Install section of the INF for each model. For example, if the model of your printer is Fabrikam 1234, then you would type the following:

```inf
"Fabrikam 1234"=DriverInstall, USBPRINT\\Fabrikam1234
"Fabrikam 1234"=DriverInstall, WSDPRINT\\Fabrikam1234
```

#### 6. Add **PrinterDriverID** to the INF file

In Visual Studio, in the Solution Explorer, expand the *MyV4PrintDriver* node.

Click **Driver Files**, then in the **Properties** window look at the value for the *Unique Identifier* field. This is the driver ID (the GUID). Highlight it and copy it

In the INF file, in the **\[Standard.NT$ARCH$\]** section, type the following line:

```inf
"Fabrikam 1234"=DriverInstall,
```

And then after the comma, paste the GUID that you copied in the preceding step. The completed **\[Standard.NT$ARCH$\]** section should look like the following:

```inf
"Fabrikam 1234"=DriverInstall, {GUID}
"Fabrikam 1234"=DriverInstall, USBPRINT\Fabrikam1234
"Fabrikam 1234"=DriverInstall, WSDPRINT\Fabrikam1234
```

#### 7. Configure the **\[Strings\]** section

Find the line containing **\[Strings\]**.

Below this you will find the definition of the *ManufacturerName* string. Replace the characters &lt;Your manufacturer name&gt; with the name of your company to provide a manufacturer’s name for the target printer and delete the rest of the line containing the ;TODO:

For example, if your company’s name is Fabrikam, you would type the following:

```inf
ManufacturerName="Fabrikam"
```

#### 8. Save the INF file

When you complete the INF file, it should look like the following:

```inf
; Copyright (c) 2017 Fabrikam
; INF file for the Fabrikam 1234 print driver

[Version]
Signature="$Windows NT$"
Class=Printer
ClassGuid={4D36E979-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the files in the preceding table, notice that a *MyV4PrintDriver Render Filter* folder was created. This is the render filter project template and it provides a good foundation for building an XPS rendering filter and an XPS filter pipeline configuration file. For more information about XPS rendering filters, see [XPSDrv Render Module](xpsdrv-render-module.md), and to see an example of an XPS rendering filter, see the [XPS Rasterization Filter Service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617951) sample.
