# Signing a Catalog File with a Commercial Release Certificate


Use the following [**SignTool**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/signtool) command to sign the [catalog file](catalog-files.md) of a kernel-mode [driver package](driver-packages.md) with a [commercial release certificate](commercial-release-certificate.md).

**Note**  For 32-bit versions of Windows Vista and later versions of Windows, only a commercial release certificate can be used to sign kernel-mode drivers to be released on these Windows versions.

 

```cpp
SignTool sign /v /s CertificateStore /n CertificateName /t http://timestamp.digicert.com CatalogFileName.cat
```

Where:

-   The **sign** command configures SignTool to sign the catalog file *CatalogFileName.cat*.

-   The **/v** verbose option configures SignTool to print execution and warning messages.

-   The **/s** *CertificateStore* option specifies the name of the certificate store that contains the *CertificateName* certificate. Follow the instructions of the certification authority (CA) that issued the certificate on how to install the certificate in the system certificate stores.

-   The **/n** *CertificateName* option specifies the name of the certificate in the *CertificateStore* certificate store.

-   The **/t**  *http://timestamp.digicert.com* option supplies the URL to the publicly-available time-stamp server that DigiCert provides.

-   *CatalogFileName.cat* is the name of the catalog file.
