# Closing a Session to the Filter Engine


After a callout driver has performed the desired management tasks, it should close the session to the filter engine. A callout driver does this by calling the [**FwpmEngineClose0**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/fwpmk/nf-fwpmk-fwpmengineclose0) function. For example:

```C++
status =
 FwpmEngineClose0(
 engineHandle  // An handle to the open session
    );
```
