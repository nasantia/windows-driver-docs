## Overview

Windows 10, version 1903 is the first version of Windows to support a preview release of 5G mobile broadband driver development by IHV partners. The name *5G* is friendly name for New Radio (NR), which was introduced in the [3GPP Release 15 specification](https://www.3gpp.org/release-15). NR is a comprehensive set of standards that is envisioned to provide true long-term evolution to existing 4th generation LTE technologies, potentially covering all cellular communication needs from narrowband to ultra-broadband, and from nominal to mission-critical latency requirements. As a technology, 5G is expected to develop over a decade-long time frame. 

This topic describes the MBIM extensions first released  in Windows 10 version 1903, which enable hardware partner to develop an MBB driver with data-class support for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) over 5G “non-standalone” EPC-based NR networks. The data-plane support and enablement for 5G throughput and commercialization requirements are not part of this Windows release and not described in this topic. 

## Windows 5G MBIM interface extension

### MBIM interface

As of Windows 10, version 1903, 5G on the whole is still developing. From a network deployment perspective, 5G is expected to be deployed in two major phases: 

* In Phase 1, most mobile network operators are expected to deploy 5G with the addition of 5G radio to the existing LTE radio and EPC core deployments, commonly known “nonstandalone 5G” networks.  

* In Phase 2, mobile network operators are expected to replace EPCs and NGCs and densify the 5G radio deployment in parallel to enable true “standalone”, or NR-NGC-based 5G networks. Phase 2 interface extensions are not in scope in this topic or Windows release. 

Interface extensions to support basic Phase 1 network requirements, or ”nonstandalone”EPC-based5G networks, was introduced in Windows 10, version 1903. In order to be extensible and fully backward compatible with legacy modems, a new Microsoft MBIM extension version (2.0) is introduced. 

The new Microsoft MBIM extesnion version is required because the [MBIM 1.0 errata specification](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/MBIM10Errata1_073013.zip) has a mechanism to add and advertise optional CIDs, but it lacks a mechanism to change the existing CIDs (new payloads or modified payload) or to introduce changes in any aspect that cannot be accommodated by optional CIDs. Each payload may consist of fixed sized members or dynamic sized (offset/size pairs) members. If one or more  dynamically sized members exist, then the last member has a variable size buffer.  

This spec also adds anew CID for the host to advertise its MBIM Release version and Extensions Release version to MBIM devices. For legacy drivers that are already in the field, this CID is optional so backward compatibility is fully maintained.  For more detail, see [MBIM Extensions Release 2.0](#mbim-extensions-release-20---5g-nonstandalone-epc-based-option-3-network-support) network support). 

### NDIS interface

NDIS supports a revision number in the NDIS_HEADER. This permits adding new members to an OID message, which NDIS uses the optional service caps table in [OID_WWAN_DEVICE_CAPS_EX](oid-wwan-device-caps-ex.md).

The following NDIS OIDs and their data structures have been updated for 5G data class support.

- [OID_WWAN_DEVICE_CAPS_EX](oid-wwan-device-caps-ex.md)
- [OID_WWAN_REGISTER_STATE](oid-wwan-register-state.md)
- [OID_WWAN_PACKET_SERVICE](oid-wwan-packet-service.md)
- [OID_WWAN_SIGNAL_STATE](oid-wwan-signal-state.md)

The equivalent MBIM CID messages for these OIDs are described in the following sections of this topic.

## MBIM Extensions Release 2.0 - 5G nonstandalone (EPC-based Option 3) network support

Because the [MBIM 1.0 errata specification](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/MBIM10Errata1_073013.zip) lacks a mechanism to change existing CIDs with new or modified payloads, Windows 10, version 1903 introduces MBIM 1.0 Extension 2.0 to extend the interface to support 5G.

### Versioning scheme

> [!NOTE]
> In this section, the term *MBIMEx version* refers to the MBIM Extensions release number.

The host learns a device's MBIMEx version through two ways:

1. The MBIM EXTENDED FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTOR.
2. The optional MBM_CID_VERSION message, if the device supports it and declares support for it.

If these two are different, the higher version dictates the MBIMEx version for the duration that the device stays enumerated to the host. The higher MBIMEx version is referred to as the device's *announced MBIMEx version*. A device's announced MBIMEx version can be lower than its native MBIMEx version, which is the highest MBIMEx version that the device supports. Devices can learn the host's MBIMEx version explicitly only via the MBIM_CID_VERSION message.

In any release, the host always queries the device for supported services and CIDs using MBIM_CID_DEVICE_SERVICES at the beginning of the device initialization sequence. If a device supports MBIM_CID_VERSION and advertises its support in the MBIM_CID_DEVICE_SERVICE query response, then a host that does not understand MBIM_CID_VERSION or has an MBIMEx version lower than 2.0 ignores it. Meanwhile, a host that does understand MBIM_CID_VERSION and has a native MBIMEx version of 2.0 or higher sends a MBIM_CID_VERSION message to the device with the host's native MBIMEx version, and the CID is the first CID that is sent to the device after receiving the MBIM_CID_DEVICE_SERVICES response.

If the device receives MBIM_CID_VERSION from the host as the first received CID after responding to the MBIM_CID_DEVICE_SERVICES query, the device knows the host's MBIMEx version. If the device receives any other CID from the host as the first received CID after responding to the MBIM_CID_DEVICE_SERVICES query, then the device assumes that the host's native MBIMEx version is 1.0.

Feature-wise, a higher MBIMEx version is a superset of all lower MBIMEx versions. A host supports all devices with an announced MBIMEx version at or below the host's native MBIMEx version. If a device's announced MBIMEx version is higher than a host's native MBIMEx version, the host is not expected to support the device and the exact behavior of the host in this situation is undefined.

A device that intends to work with older hosts should initially advertise MBIMEx version 1.0, or the lowest host MBIMEx version with which the device is intended to work, in an MBIM extended functional descriptor. If the host sends MBIM_CID_VERSION and the host has a higher MBIMEx version than the device initially advertises, then the device should, in the MBIM_CID_VERSION response, indicate a higher MBIMEx version up to the smaller of the host's native MBIMEx version and the device's native MBIMEx version.

> [!NOTE]
> For example, a device supports MBIMEx version 2.0, but is intended to work with older versions of the OS that do not support MBIMEx 2.0. The device initially advertises MBIMEx version 1.0 in the USB descriptors and advertises support for the optional MBIM_CID_VERSION. When inserted into a host running Windows 10, version 1803, the host does not understand MBIM_CID_VERSION and does not send MBIM_CID_VERSION to the device. To the host, the device's MBIMEx version is 1.0. The host continues to send other CIDs in the initialization sequence. Upon receiving CIDs other than MBIM_CID_VERSION, the device knows that the host supports MBIMEx version 1.0. Both sides proceed to conform to MBIMEx version 1.0. Later, when the same device is inserted into a host running Windows 10, version 1903 with a native MBIMEx version of 2.0, the host sends MBIM_CID_VERSION to the device to inform it that the host's native MBIMEx version is 2.0. The device sends MBIM_CID_VERSION back in response with the device's announced MBIMEx version 2.0. From there, both sides proceed to conform to MBIMEx version 2.0.

The following table shows a compatibility matrix with three hypothetical hosts and three hypothetical devices, each with its native MBIMEx version stated. The devices advertise MBIMEx version 1.0 initially in the USB descriptor. The matrix shows how each of the devices behaves with each of the hosts.

| Device (below) / Host (right) | Windows 10, version 1809 or earlier (native MBIMEx version 1.0) | Windows 10, version 1903 and later (MBIMEx version 2.0) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4G device <p>Native MBIMEx version 1.0</p> | Device initially advertises MBIMEx 1.0. No MBIM_CID_VERSION exchange. Compatible device and host. Works by default with MBIMEx version 1.0. | Device initially advertises MBIMEx 1.0. No MBIM_CID_VERSION exchange. The host works with the device using MBIMEx 1.0. |
| 5G NSA device <p>Native MBIMEx version 2.0</p> | Device initially advertises MBIMEx 1.0. No MBIM_CID_VERSION exchange. Device knows that the host has MBIMEx 1.0 and proceeds with MBIMEx 1.0. | Device initially advertises MBIMEx 1.0. Host sends MBIM_CID_VERSION to inform the device that the host supports MBIMEx 2.0. Device responds with MBIMEx 2.0. Both sides proceed with MBIMEx 2.0. |

The following table lists all existing CIDs that are modified in MBIMEx version 2.0, and their modified payloads. All unmentioned payloads in these CIDs and all other CIDs not mentioned in the table carry over from MBIMEx version 1.0 and remain unchanged. 

| CID | Payload |

| Microsoft Basic IP Connectivity Extensions | UUID_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS | 3D01DCC5-FEF5-4D05-9D3A-BEF7058E9AAF |

## MBIM_CID_VERSION

For MBB drivers that support MBIM Microsoft extension 2.0 or above, MBIM_CID_VERSION is a mandatory command for exchanging MBIM version information between the host and the device. For in-market devices with drivers that do not recognize this CID, the host will assume and provide backward compatibility.

The host sends this command as a query if it is supported by the device. The query contains the MBIM release number and MBIM Extensions release number that the host currently supports.

On the device side, the device adjusts its announced MBIM release number and MBIM Extensions release number based on the rules defined in [versioning scheme](#versioning-scheme), then sends them in the response to the host.

This command is defined under the **Basic Connect Extensions** service.

### Status Codes

This CID only uses generic status codes defined in Section 9.4.5 of the [MBIM specification revision 1.0](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/MBIM10Errata1_073013.zip).

## MBIM_CID_SIGNAL_STATE

This CID is an extension to MBIM_CID_SIGNAL_STATE, introducing RSRP and SNR for signal state criteria. This new extension is only valid if the device indicates support of MBIM Extensions version 2.0. This extension is mandatory if the modem supports MBIMDataClass5G_(N)SA data classes.

The RSRP and SNR fields are only valid if the corresponding SystemType is either MGBIMDataClassLTE or MBIMDataClass5G_(N)SA. IF the modem reports RSRP and/or SNR, then the RSSI field shall be set to a value of **99**.

If the corresponding SystemType is MBIMDataClass5G_(N)SA, the RSRP field is mandatory and the SNR field is optional. If the corresponding SystemType is MBIMDataClassLTE, the RSRP and SNR fields are optional and the RSSI field can be used instead. In this case, the RSRP and SNR fields can be omitted by setting a zero (**0**) value for both **RsrpSnrOffset** and **RsrpSnrSize** members.
