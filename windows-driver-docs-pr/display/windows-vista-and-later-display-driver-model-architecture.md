# Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) Architecture


## <span id="ddk_longhorn_display_driver_model_architecture_gg"></span><span id="DDK_LONGHORN_DISPLAY_DRIVER_MODEL_ARCHITECTURE_GG"></span>


The display driver model architecture for the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM), available starting with WindowsÂ Vista, is composed of user-mode and kernel-mode parts. The following figure shows the architecture required to support WDDM.

A graphics hardware vendor must supply the user-mode display driver and the display miniport driver. The user-mode display driver is a dynamic-link library (DLL) that is loaded by the Microsoft Direct3D runtime. The display *miniport driver* communicates with the Microsoft DirectX graphics kernel subsystem. For more information about the user-mode display driver and display miniport driver, see the [Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/_display/).
