# ServiceInfo XML schema overview

[!include[MBAE deprecation warning](mbae-deprecation-warning.md)]

A service metadata package contains one ServiceInfo.xml document, which contains detailed information about the service that Windows Connection Manager displays to the user.

The data in the ServiceInfo.xml document is formatted based on the ServiceInfo XML schema, which is described in this section.

**Note**  
The XML document must be saved by using UTF-8 encoding.

 

For the complete definition of the ServiceInfo XML schema, see [ServiceInfo XML Schema Definition](serviceinfo-xml-schema-definition.md).

For information about the data types that are defined by the ServiceInfo XML schema, see [ServiceInfo XML Data Types](serviceinfo-xml-data-types.md).

For an example of XML data in the format that is defined by the ServiceInfo XML schema, see [ServiceInfo XML Example](serviceinfo-xml-example.md).
