# Enabling Device Wake-Up





If a device supports wake-up, its power policy owner must be able to enable and disable wake-up for the device. A driver enables wake up by sending an [**IRP\_MJ\_POWER**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mj-power) request with minor function code [**IRP\_MN\_WAIT\_WAKE**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-wait-wake) and disables wake-up by canceling a previously sent **IRP\_MN\_WAIT\_WAKE**. A device can have only one **IRP\_MN\_WAIT\_WAKE** request pending at a time.

To determine whether its device supports wake-up, the device power states from which it can signal wake-up, and the system power states from which the device can wake the system, a driver checks the **SystemWake**, **DeviceWake**, and **WakeFromD***x* members in the [**DEVICE\_CAPABILITIES**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_device_capabilities) structure.

For more information about enabling, disabling, and responding to wake-up signals in a driver, see [Supporting Devices that Have Wake-Up Capabilities](supporting-devices-that-have-wake-up-capabilities.md).
