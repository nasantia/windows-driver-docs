# Introduction to Extra Create Parameters

Extra create parameters (ECPs) are structures that can contain additional information for file creates. A create operation can have any number of ECPs, which are attached using an ECP_LIST. Operating system components use ECPs to associate additional information with the [**IRP_MJ_CREATE**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/irp-mj-create) operation on a file.

Drivers can also use ECPs to process or associate additional information with the IRP_MJ_CREATE operation on a file in the following situations:

- When a kernel-mode driver calls the [**FltCreateFileEx2**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/fltkernel/nf-fltkernel-fltcreatefileex2) or [**IoCreateFileEx**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/ntddk/nf-ntddk-iocreatefileex) routine to create or open the file

- When a file system filter driver processes the [**IRP_MJ_CREATE**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/irp-mj-create) operation for the file

The following sections describe how to define, attach, and use ECPs. The following sections also describe operating system-defined ECPs.
