# Creating Property Sheet Pages





Property sheet pages created using CPSUI are made up of [property sheet options](property-sheet-options.md), where each option represents a user-modifiable value. Dialogs for property sheet options are created using a set of [CPSUI-supported window controls](cpsui-supported-window-controls.md) that let a user modify an option's value.

CPSUI-supplied window controls can be displayed within [CPSUI-supplied pages and templates](cpsui-supplied-pages-and-templates.md), or they can be used with customized pages. There are several [methods for specifying pages](methods-for-specifying-pages.md), all of which involve calling CPSUI's [**ComPropSheet**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/compstui/nc-compstui-pfncompropsheet) function.

Creating property sheet pages for printers and print documents involves [using CPSUI with printer drivers](using-cpsui-with-printer-drivers.md) and requires interaction between an application, the print spooler, a printer interface DLL, and CPSUI.
