# Opening a Device's Hardware Key


A *hardware key* is device-specific registry subkey that contains information about the device. You must not directly open a device's hardware key. As with any registry key, the location or format of these keys might change between different versions of Windows. 

**Note**  You should open a device's hardware key only after the corresponding device has been found. For more information about this procedure, see [Enumerating Installed Devices](enumerating-installed-devices.md).

 

To open or create a device's hardware key, follow these guidelines:

-   To open an existing hardware key, use [**SetupDiOpenDevRegKey**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupdiopendevregkey). To create a hardware key, use [**SetupDiCreateDevRegKey**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupdicreatedevregkeya). In either case, you must set the *KeyType* parameter to DIREG_DEV.

    **Note**  You must set the *samDesired* parameter to the minimal access permissions that are required. You must not set this parameter to KEY_ALL_ACCESS. For more information about how to specify access permissions for registry access, see [Accessing Registry Keys Safely](accessing-registry-keys-safely.md).

     

-   Kernel-mode callers should use [**IoOpenDeviceRegistryKey**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-ioopendeviceregistrykey) and set the *DevInstKeyType* parameter to PLUGPLAY_REGKEY_DEVICE.
