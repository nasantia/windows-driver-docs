# SoftwareInfo XML schema overview

[!include[MBAE deprecation warning](mbae-deprecation-warning.md)]

A metadata package contains one SoftwareInfo.xml document, which contains information that the operating system downloads a UWP app. This information results in privileged access for apps.

The data within the Softwareinfo.xml document is formatted based on the SoftwareInfo XML Schema, which is described in this section.

**Note**  
The XML document must be saved by using UTF-8 encoding.

 

For the complete definition of the SoftwareInfo XML schema, see [SoftwareInfo XML Schema Definition](softwareinfo-xml-schema-definition.md).

For information about the elements that are defined by the SoftwareInfo XML schema, see [SoftwareInfo XML Schema Definition](softwareinfo-xml-schema-definition.md).

For an example of XML data in the format that is defined by the SoftwareInfo XML schema, see [SoftwareInfo XML Example](softwareinfo-xml-example.md).
