# Percent of machines with display issues when resume from low power state

## Description

When a machine is booting from a low power state, an error in the graphics component can cause display issues that impact the usersâ€™ experience. This measure is calculating the percent of machines that experienced display issues when resuming in a low power state. For a list of display issues, see the [Appendix](measure-appendix.md#display-issues).

## Measure attributes

|Attribute|Value|
|----|----|
|**Audience**|Ecosystem|
|**Time period**|7-day sliding window|
|**Measurement criteria**|Aggregation of machines|
|**Minimum population**|100 machines that were in a low power state|
|**Passing criteria**|<= 0.8% of machines in low power states encounter display issues|
|**Measure ID**|19920755|

## Calculation

1. The measure aggregates telemetry from a 7-day sliding window into a **percent of machines that encountered display issues when resuming from a low power state.**
2. *Number of machines with display issues = count(machines that experienced display issues when resuming from a low power state)*
3. *Total machines = count(machines that performed a low to high power state transition during flight)*

### Final calculation

*Percent of machines that experienced display issues when resuming from low power = Number of machines with display issues / Total machines*
