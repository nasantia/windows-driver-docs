Beginning with Windows 7, a display miniport driver can set additional members in the [**DXGK\_PRESENTATIONCAPS**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_presentationcaps) structure to indicate certain rendering operations that the driver can or cannot support.

For further information about available rendering capability settings, see [**DXGK\_PRESENTATIONCAPS**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_presentationcaps).
