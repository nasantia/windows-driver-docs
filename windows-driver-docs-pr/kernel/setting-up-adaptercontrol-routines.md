# Setting Up AdapterControl Routines





A driver's dispatch routine for a PnP [**IRP\_MN\_START\_DEVICE**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/irp-mn-start-device) request must do the following for an [*AdapterControl*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_control) routine:

1.  Set up the adapter object for the device's DMA capabilities by filling in a [**DEVICE\_DESCRIPTION**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_device_description) structure and calling [**IoGetDmaAdapter**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iogetdmaadapter).

2.  Save the adapter object pointer and *NumberOfMapRegisters* returned by **IoGetDmaAdapter**.

    The platform-specific maximum *NumberOfMapRegisters* returned by **IoGetDmaAdapter** or the transfer capabilities of the driver's device, whichever is more restrictive, determines whether the driver must split up a given transfer request and carry out more than one DMA operation on its device to satisfy that IRP.

The returned adapter object pointer, the entry point of the driver's *AdapterControl* routine, the *DeviceObject* pointer representing the target device for the current IRP, a *Context* pointer to an area already set up for the *AdapterControl* routine, and a *NumberOfMapRegisters* value, which can be less than the maximum possible number for smaller transfer requests, must be passed in calls to [**AllocateAdapterChannel**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-pallocate_adapter_channel). Usually, a driver's [*StartIo*](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nc-wdm-driver_startio) (or possibly [*ControllerControl*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff542049)) routine sets up the area at *Context* before it calls **AllocateAdapterChannel**.
