# Getting started with Windows drivers


Start here to learn fundamental concepts about drivers.

You should already be familiar with the [C programming language](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-language/c-language-reference), and you should understand the ideas of function pointers, callback functions, and event handlers. If you are going to write a driver based on User-Mode Driver Framework 1.x, you should be familiar with [C++ and COM](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p?LinkID=317460).
