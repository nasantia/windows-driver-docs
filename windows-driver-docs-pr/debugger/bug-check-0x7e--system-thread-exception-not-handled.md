# Bug Check 0x7E: SYSTEM\_THREAD\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED


The SYSTEM\_THREAD\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED bug check has a value of 0x0000007E. This bug check indicates that a system thread generated an exception that the error handler did not catch.

Cause
-----

This bug check indicates that a system thread generated an exception that the error handler did not catch. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.

Common exception codes include the following:

- 0x80000002: STATUS\_DATATYPE\_MISALIGNMENT indicates an unaligned data reference was encountered.

- 0x80000003: STATUS\_BREAKPOINT indicates a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.

- 0xC0000005: STATUS\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.

For a complete list of exception codes, see [NTSTATUS values](https://docs.microsoft.com/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-erref/596a1078-e883-4972-9bbc-49e60bebca55). The exception codes are defined in *ntstatus.h*, a header file provided by the [Windows Driver Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/). (For more info, see [Header files in the Windows Driver Kit](../gettingstarted/header-files-in-the-windows-driver-kit.md)). 


Resolution
----------

If you plan to debug this problem, the exception address (parameter 2) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.

If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. If the issue is narrowed down to a single driver, set breakpoints and single-step forward in code to locate the failure and gain insight into events leading up to the crash.

The [**!analyze**](-analyze.md) debugger extension displays information about the bug check and can be helpful in determining the root cause. 

Additional analysis can be done by using the [**!thread**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-thread) extension, as well as the [**dds**, **dps**, and **dqs** (display words and symbols)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/dds--dps--dqs--display-words-and-symbols-) commands. This can be a reasonable technique when WinDbg reports "Probably caused by : ntkrnlmp.exe." 

If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the **/NODEBUG** switch. This problem should not occur frequently. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the **/DEBUG** switch.

If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.

For more information about WinDbg and **!analyze**, see the following topics:

 - [Analyze crash dump files by using WinDbg](crash-dump-files.md)

 - [Analyzing a kernel-mode dump file with WinDbg](analyzing-a-kernel-mode-dump-file-with-windbg.md)

 - [Using the !analyze extension](using-the--analyze-extension.md) and [!analyze](-analyze.md)


Remarks
-------

If you are not equipped to use the Windows debugger to work on this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques:

-   Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.

-   If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.

-   Check with your hardware vendor for any ACPI or other firmware updates. Hardware issues, such as system incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.

-   You can also disable memory caching/shadowing of the BIOS to try to resolve the error. Also run hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies.

-   Confirm that any new hardware that is installed is compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about required hardware at [Windows 10 Specifications](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-specifications).
