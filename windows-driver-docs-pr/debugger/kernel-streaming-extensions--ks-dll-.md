# Kernel Streaming Extensions (Ks.dll)


Extension commands that are useful for debugging kernel streaming drivers and AVStream drivers can be found in Ks.dll.

Most of the sample output in these reference pages was generated by debugging the filter-centric sample Avssamp.sys. This sample is included in the Windows Driver Kit.

You need special symbols to use this extension. For more information, see the [Debugging Tools for Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=8708) Web site.

You can get additional information for many of the extension commands in this section simply by entering the command into the debugger with no arguments.

For more information, see [Kernel Streaming Debugging](kernel-streaming-debugging.md).
