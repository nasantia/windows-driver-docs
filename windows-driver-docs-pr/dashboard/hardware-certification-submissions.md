# Hardware submissions

The Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (for Windows 10) and the Windows Hardware Certification Program (for Windows 8/8.1 and older operating systems) enable you to design, create, and test your hardware and drivers before you submit the final version through the Partner Center. For more information, see the [Windows hardware certification](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=224782) page. By certifying your hardware device, system, and drivers for Windows, you gain the support of Microsoft marketing resources in the form of compatibility and reliability listings, logo artwork, and promotional partnerships.

To develop your device, download the [Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk).

To test your device, download the [Windows Hardware Lab Kit (Windows HLK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/test/hlk/windows-hardware-lab-kit) for Windows 10. For previous operating systems, download the [Windows Hardware Certification Kit (Windows HCK)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/test/hlk/windows-hardware-lab-kit) or [Windows Logo Kit (WLK)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=219237).

After you develop and test your product, you can submit the results with a hardware submission.

> [!NOTE]
> We strongly encourage you to include public driver symbols as part your HLK package. See [Public Symbols and Private Symbols](../devtest/public-symbols-and-private-symbols.md) to learn how to create public symbols.  See [Step 8: Create a submission package](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/test/hlk/getstarted/step-8-create-a-submission-package) to learn how to include symbols with your package. Note that any .pdb files in your submission will be removed before being published.

- To submit an HLK or HCK package, see [Create a new hardware submission](create-a-new-hardware-submission.md).

- To submit a WLK package, see [Create a new WLK device certification submission](create-a-new-hardware-logo-submission.md) for more information.

## Drivers summary page

The Drivers summary page contains a list of all hardware certification submissions that you have created or are shared with you. You can create a new hardware submission by selecting the **Create new driver** button.

## Hardware submission page

A hardware submission page contains information about a specific hardware submission, including status, packages, certification info, and shipping labels. For information about how to create a hardware submission, see [Create a new hardware submission](create-a-new-hardware-submission.md).

![screenshot that shows a hardware submission page](images/hardware-submission-page.png)

The left side of the page contains a list of the 10 most recently viewed submissions.

You can monitor the progress of your submission with the progress tracker at the top of the page. Once all steps show a green check, the submission is complete and your company will receive a notification.

### Packages and signing properties

This section shows you how to manage your packages.

Select **Upload new** to upload a new package.

Select **Download DUA shell** to download the DUA shell package. For information about how to update a submission using DUA, see [Manage hardware submissions](manage-your-hardware-submissions.md).

The uploaded package list displays your uploaded packages for this submission. Select the caret to expand a package. This shows you the submission ID and allows you to select **Download package** to download the package.

**Additional certifications** displays any chosen additional certifications.

Submissions are automatically assigned Declarative and Universal attributes based off the entire submission contents.  If you want a submission to be marked as `Declarative=True` and/or `Universal=True`, all files and INFs within the submission must be compliant with the appropriate attribute(s).  For example, a merged HLK package can contain two driver sets for different OS certifiations. If one set is Declarative and another set is not, the entire submission would be marked as `Declarative=False`. INF only packages will have Universal greyed out as there are no binaries to validate.  Each set should be separated into two submissions to ensure they are marked appropriately. 

If you want to add or update your announcement date, use the **Announcement date (UTC)** field and select **Submit**.

You can also add or remove marketing names. To add a name, enter it in the **Marketing name** text box and select **Add**. To remove a name, select the red X button next to the marketing name you want to remove. You can also add multiple names at once by selecting **Add multiple names**. When you are finished, select **Submit**.

### Distribution

This section displays shipping label information for this submission. For information about how to use shipping labels, see the [Manage driver distribution with shipping labels](manage-driver-distribution-by-submission.md) section.

Select **New shipping label** to create a new shipping label.

Select **Publish all pending** to publish all shipping labels that are not yet published.

The shipping label list displays the shipping labels for this submission. This list includes shipping labels you created, and partner shipping labels for your shared driver.
