- Enable a new channel for cellular activation through adoption of eSIM
- Increase adoption of cellular services on Windows PCs through a direct relationship between customers and mobile operators

Mobile Plans is supported in Windows 10, version 1803 and later.

## User experience

The following sections illustrate the Mobile Plans user experience.

### Launching the app

The Mobile Plans app can be launched from a number of different entry points. The most common entry point is the network flyout, as this is where users typically manage their active network interfaces in Windows 10. The cellular interface can be expanded to show status of the cellular network. In the example below, the device has no SIM profile activated, so the user sees a call to action to “Connect with a data plan.” Clicking this link will launch the Mobile Plans app.

See the [Mobile Plans account management](mobile-plans-account-management.md) topic for more details on behavior of the network flyout.

The app can also be launched from a toast notification. Clicking the “Get connected” button will launch the Mobile Plans app.

See the [Mobile Plans toast notifications](mobile-plans-notifications.md) topic for more details on the behavior of toast notifications.
