# MB Operation Flowchart Topics


All the scenarios described in this section assume that the miniport driver and MB Service have completed initialization described in [MB Miniport Driver Initialization](mb-miniport-driver-initialization.md).

The following topics describe the operational flow for various configurations and scenarios when processing OIDs:

[Initialization of non SIM-Locked GPRS Device with Provisioned Context](initialization-of-a-non-sim-locked-gprs-device-with-a-provisioned-cont.md)

[Initialization of SIM-Locked GPRS Device with User Defined Context](initialization-of-sim-locked-gprs-device-with-a-user-defined-context.md)

[Initialization of CDMA Packet Device with Provisioned Context](initialization-of-a-cdma-packet-device-with-a-provisioned-context.md)

[Losing and Regaining Packet Data Service](losing-and-regaining-packet-data-service.md)

[Packet Data Service Handoffs](packet-data-service-handoffs.md)

[Voice Calls during Packet Data Service Connections](voice-calls-during-packet-data-service-connections.md)

[Signal Strength Indication Semantics](signal-strength-indication-semantics.md)
