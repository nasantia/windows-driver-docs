# Allocating DMA Engines


The HD Audio controller contains a fixed number of DMA engines. Each engine can perform scatter/gather transfers for a single render or capture stream.

Three types of DMA engines are available:

-   Render DMA engines, which can handle only render streams.

-   Capture DMA engines, which can handle only capture streams.

-   Bidirectional DMA engines, which can be configured to handle either render or capture streams.

When allocating a DMA engine for a render stream, the [**AllocateCaptureDmaEngine**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/hdaudio/nc-hdaudio-pallocate_capture_dma_engine) routine allocates a render DMA engine if one is available. If the supply of render DMA engines is exhausted, the routine allocates a bidirectional DMA engine if one is available.

Similarly, when allocating a DMA engine for a capture stream, the [**AllocateRenderDmaEngine**](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/hdaudio/nc-hdaudio-pallocate_render_dma_engine) routine allocates a capture DMA engine if one is available. If the supply of capture DMA engines is exhausted, the routine allocates a bidirectional DMA engine if one is available.

The Allocate*Xxx*DmaEngine routines are available in both versions of the HD Audio DDI.
