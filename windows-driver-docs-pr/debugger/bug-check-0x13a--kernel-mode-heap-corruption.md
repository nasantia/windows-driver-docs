### Parameter 1 - Type of heap corruption

0x3 : A corrupt entry header was detected.

0x4 : Multiple corrupt entry headers were detected.

0x5 : A corrupt entry header in a large allocation was detected.

0x6 : A corruption was detected with features consistent with a buffer overrun.

0x7 : A corruption was detected with features consistent with a buffer underrun.

0x8 : A free block was passed to an operation that is only valid for busy blocks.

0x9 : An invalid argument was specified for the current operation.

0xA : An invalid allocation type was detected.

0xB : A corruption was detected with features consistent with a use-after-free error.

0xC : The wrong heap was specified for the current operation.

0xD : A corrupt free list was detected.

0xE : The heap detected list corruption in a list other than the free list.

0xF : A free block was passed to an operation that is only valid for busy blocks.

0x10 : The heap detected invalid internal state during the current operation. This is usually the result of a buffer overflow.

0x11 : The heap detected invalid internal state during the current operation. This is usually the result of a buffer overflow.

0x12 : The heap detected invalid internal state during the current operation. This is usually the result of a buffer overflow.

0x13 : The heap API was passed a NULL heap handle. Look at the call stack and to determine why a bad handle was supplied to the heap.

0x14 : The requested heap allocation is larger then the current allocation limit.

0x15 : In the process of performing a commit request, it was determined that the request would exceed the current commit limit.

0x16 : In the process of checking the size of the given VA Manager allocation, it was determined that the query was invalid.

## Resolution

The [**!analyze**](-analyze.md) debug extension displays information about the bug check and can be helpful in determining the root cause.

The [!heap](-heap.md) extension displays heap usage information, controls breakpoints in the heap manager, detects leaked heap blocks, searches for heap blocks, or displays page heap information.
